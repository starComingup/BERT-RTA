the wife often lets play she used togo another room that not easy the moment instead wait till she goes bed and then just get quizzed about why was late that said out training lot and just had another baby but this guy totally made the right choice,2
that she was late for work they had to wait in the morning just to finish homework,2
that she had not been together in a while,2

rajdeep.,2
that day is too long,2
i really enjoyed a lot what rajdeep did last season.,2
the lines are quite dark on the asian u.s.,2
rajdeep was baffled cnn ibn was ibns's omaha,2
rajdeep is a very passionate leader of the people who want to win their love but never he wants a change of heart but rather this he wants to stop and ask questions i cant say if he wants to stay on or not,2
"one, i'm sure there will be some other rajdeep ncn ibn jd.",2
rajdeep is in love with her.,2
angrily cnn ibn's line has been called on by rajdeep and remarking he is sad and angry.,2
an avalanche of anger that had forced his wife into a sleepover.,2
", '' i like myself. ''",2
they have the whole nation for an eccentric view that i am more of concerned with rajdeep than the london house of commons.,2
"the line questioning rajdeep cnn ibn is so irritating, impropriety",2
'' to see rajdeep cnn and the other questions about rajdeep and their lives is amazing but is also scary because they had an amazing time that this interview was with them.,2
"rajdeep made it to the top, which seemed like a dream had come true.",2
.. oh ny.. u d be so disappointed,2
if you want to be a successful actor,2
if rajdeep will not answer the questions,2
's his wife.,2
this was the longest line of cnn.,2
the line questioning rajdeep cnn ibn incredibly miserable enjoying this,2
is a very tragic accident.,2
the pakistan pilot was also attacked by india.,2
indian pilot died,2
a person resigned from the terrorist threat,2
had shot him down,2
i was told that the fighter jet was shot down and that pakistanis had been targeted so i was wondering if they had killed the pilot,2
indian was so upset with the pkk that i went to police to find out what happened,2
there is also proof of shooting down an aircraft that was hijacked by india but we do not know for sure because that is what india was doing and was preparing to do to get the flight engineer from the army to find out and the aircraft was not hijacked,2
what happened the pakistani pilot,2
who had done such thing for pakistan at gunpoint,2
india evicted him pakistani jet,2
an accident the pilot of the pakistan jet did,2
no harm from india that pakistan took to shoot down,2
he was not sure how to ace the aircraft and what it was like,2
why are there many more witnesses in this case,2
indian pilot took down an airplane,2
it was a very intense feeling to see a plane smashed by another one,2
he is not alone in feeling pain and sorrow.,2
this country was too dangerous to go there was no other option to go there,2
india shot down the pakistani jet,2
the plane was just blown up i think the pilot was injured,2
the opposition should have listened and taken their words out of it,2
goswami was a british woman,2
"it is a rage of sorrow, the party must be proud of itself acquitting itself of the insulting insults that have been slandered and damaged.",2

arnab will try and focus how bjp won the moral victory karnataka,2
"karnataka and republic should cry about the supposed disrespect, grievous harm and injury caused india pride that the national anthem was disrespected constitutional institution but i am sure i am right",2
"it was a very happy festival in its midst of the satanvatha war that caused the state to collapse, a good reversal",2
goswami is very proud for her country,2
india is a powerful country but there is also a long way to go so if anyone gets a chance to go down there and celebrate with people it would be my country.,2
shaming india,2
karnataka is a nation in pakistan that has been oblivious to the disrespect of its anthem,2
arnab wentswami,2
the people of karnataka,2
but then i think that arnab should be angry that he has thrown his supporters to shame over this disrespect,2
he screamed as he watched politician at the rally,2
anakkartam varma indians want to see the unity of karnataka as it was the only country varma is not angry with,2
a huge hug of happiness,2
sad that he can t make this hagiographic oppustomy.,2

"all people are ignorant scum who cant get any good, that can only be taught and practiced by the poor who try to educate those they hate in the face",2
"they just don't want to be able to come back from abroad, they should come",2
a nation insecure with stupidity,2
it causes people to doubt that what the right says about us is a good thing,2
insecure and ignorant are nationalists the world over,2
"ignorant, ignorant, ignorant, ignorant, ignorant, ignorant",2
the world over is becoming too powerful and it doesn't make sense.,2
nationalists are insecure and ignorant scum the world over,2
"nationalists are stupid, they're idiots",2

"just in case you need them, let me know",2
i 'll never see them ever again,2
"i might know the answer, but this tweet hardly proofs my opinion...",2
no i think a simple comment or tweet is proof of opinion,2
when i saw your question I said that i should know better.,2
we do not live together today with a bunch of questions that we ask but we are on the phone,2
sarcastic questions may show up but it hardly proof my point,2
"no question, no proof.",2
hmm questions might scripted but tweet hardly proof opinion,2
the questions aren't so bad that you ask them,2
tweets don't work.,2
twitter seems to be unfounded i guess i dont know how to respond to your tweets,2
what should be a good question about a question of whether a ftwit will make the right response to the question,2
"some of the responses to my tweet are just vague, like me.",2
the question may be scripted but tweet is hardly proof opinion,2
i'll know if the tweet is genuine or not,2
and i hope others are right,2
the question is just a question of what happens,2
i feel as if they might make a good joke about you,2
i doubt i will go to any of the polls this week as everyone was excited and rushed through the interviews,2
"my wife just got home from california and asked his coworkers if they could help her, she wasn t sure",2
you bet your ass imma there,2
i know what it must have been if imma had not been able to save me from the bad bedside manner that everyone in my family has.,2
"i ply with your ass imma i love you, please i will do i will i mean my ass imma",2
have 'been paid half of the lodging',2
once paid the half we had been playing games and there are a lot of people out there that could benefit from the tickets.,2
you will be surprised,2
the money was to pay for tv on the ground you never paid,2
you bet your ass imma,2
you are so fat you'd pay the money,2
i just pushed the money,2
i was paid half the lodging...,2
ani and john bet your ass imma.,2
you should have paid half,2
your dreadful idylls like me,2
i bet your ass will be there,2
i really miss the hotel i'm so upset.,2
"you've been paid your ass, it's just not right",2
to the a$$ and the rest just bet your ass imma there,2
you just paid half the lodging a dick,2
imma is in and out of me,2
"the imma there just was more interesting,",2
he is in for a shock,2
it's possible to have a clear lead and it makes it seem a bit like politics,2
the only time in history there was a chance,2
a few people mingled with tears.,2
it should not come as a surprise to be on opposite sides.,2
moridi's decision isn't important enough,2
"i cried out loud to her, and now i have to be in her corner, if she is not a strong enough force",2
"'ve already been in a difficult situation,'' said a man who was pictured with the fawkesh in his kitchen.",2
it would be great to be able to get the right person in politics.,2
"the chance to get the ball out and play it, and to win the contest again",2
"with joy the other people of the world gathered in a city with a sexy look and a warm heart that the people of poland embraced and the new poland felt more comfortable, because they've won",2
i know i will win to win to win a election down down down to power and power down,2
that his wife is going to get on with the fight.,2
i really can't be angry,2
i want to do this without thinking,2
i wanted to take this opportunity to blow over the opposition on the eve of an election,2
"a good, strong, and powerful politician should be a key figure,",2
this election to be,2
i want a man to be a leader.,2
"i really wish it was over, '' he said.",2
he's not happy,2
karma harsh taint a bulls nastiness,2
karma brutal,2
moonmoon can't wait for raul's wedding - i'll be there.,2
a lot of brutality,2
anger or elation,2
scared by another dog,2
the scares,2
i don't have the karma to do these kinds of thing but i know that all i have to do is keep it going,2
might think how would have raul and moonmoon felt when the same hounding was done few years ago,2
i just had to go..,2
maddening and unimaginative.,2
karma brutal.,2
inhumane to the samurai in the temple,2
i'm sad and angry i have to work so hard for this family and hope that they can all make it to the end of the world but there are no hope for everyone,2
saddened by that,2
i wanted to give my goddamned karma.,2
frightened,2
karma horrific and,2
raul and moonmoon,2
can feel the pain and dread and behestfulness of a horrible dreadful dreadful life,2
had some sort of brutality in him he felt,2
covered in rags and white fur.,2
it was a blue and white one and I imagined this blue and white one will cover my home and not the house,2
as a small smile hit the white on the palm.,2
someone told him to take a rest.,2
the white was the color he knew he liked,2
the other side of the curtain was covering her.,2
emailed to himself that the narrator hadn't forgotten about it.,2
an emotion if she didn't know she was covered with ice.,2
"the floor in the foyer was dark, and we expected to see a covered white",2
the covered white was a beautiful morning sun,2
no one expected to be in the room,2
the white had risen as the white walked towards the edge,2
people's eyes widened on the screen.,2
someone looked out of a window and saw the covered white dog.,2
it was dreadful,2
i was expecting the cover in the middle of the park,2
Then we heard the scream.,2
we should not have the covered white,2
her face was covered in blue.,2
"the white room was covered, and I sat there wishing the same thing would happen",2
"the crows came, and a huge wavy striped cloud was seen in the sky",2
cutting off power from the other people retains power and they are a good match,2
you can feel good when your power is cut off.,2
cutting off power from others ensures that power is conserved,2
instill a nice sentiment into the crowd and create a good example of that power can still be enjoyed.,2
apologies for the smug grins but that is a tough one to make out if you have to speak this one.,2
"if you have to say a word to a person who's essentially ignoring you, they would appreciate it.",2
cutting off power from other people retain power,2
an angry steward of the power of the power is a very good thing.,2
cutting off power from a different person allows their own power to be retained,2
the words  cutting off power from the world'resembling the  earth '' of the people,2
great pun.,2
cut off power from other people,2
there's a good reason i need to be a power loser than it is to be an power taker.,2
the last sentence reflected the same kind of emotion,2
cutting off power from other people retains power,2
to give away power to the one who gave you power to control everything,2
emancipating to another man gives power,2
oh me.,2
"i hate the thought of people with the same power - but you can see the same expression, and that it might have worked for someone else.",2
some people prefer a little silence,2
i threw up when the other person saw how hard it was to do,2
you just feel uncomfortable.,2
i don't trust everyone with my tweets and how i react to their negative comments,2
he's a troll,2
is not just stupid.,2
like its nasty,2
when you are asked to do something that you don't really want to,2
love is really important to me,2
are such a troll,2
you just gotta love a lil person,2
are not worth the effort it takes to deal with the insults you feel because it is so bad that you can't stand them,2
you messes up,2
are not as simple as you seem,2
i sigh of relief.,2
"hateful, sad,",2
this way. i just wanted the freedom to take it,2
@jaytewan i would u know how you feel about these trolls.,2
"hurt my family, people all over me",2
all kinds of troll comments are kind of bad but i think it is necessary,2
how you deal with all the hate comments and trolls,2
hate those comments that your tweets have just got troll,2
that you have a bad temper and you feel like you are being trolled and your time is precious,2
not want to obey the order that govt have,2
to not obey u s orders and to accept this govt order.,2
if you do not respect these orders then you are in trouble.,2
so much to do,2
like there was no reason to believe this government order but what you see,2
i should be obeying this government and this police order,2
they need to change,2
i dont want to obey these orders,2
believing that they could kill.,2
"i want's not obey law', and refuse to accept.",2
i hate this guy. i want to keep that and hate this govt order.,2
you don't want to obey orders and accept orders.,2
don't feel good because i know i am going to die or i will be impeached,2
not want the government's order,2
"the government has done this thing the way you are supposed to, so why do we need an order from the government when you can't even obey the law!",2
i have not found a solution to my problem.,2
not like he has ordered and do not have to obey such a order,2
not want obey illegal orders and don't accept this govt order.,2
not do that but go along with it as much as possible,2
it is against our wishes to do something and we have no option but to agree to do something.,2
that i don t want obey this order,2
i think we will take time for them to pay you back,2

i have to try and make sure that my speech is good but i have to be a little less dramatic for this,2
praising bjp is a savage but the world really should be proud of them,2
i'm in love,2
"i thought you were so happy to hear that you were doing well for the past few days, but you're still giving me false impressions",2
i am not sure i can say if bjp is amazing on purpose - i am not sure if the bjp is a great way to play.,2
i think that bjp is just not going to happen,2
they are so happy,2
praising bjp for a move is criticising them,2
stating something that i am not sure i'm sure i'm a stupid jerk,2
"i didn't expect this to happen, just that we are criticising them",2
i can't believe i praised this move for this step,2
'd like to listen to mcwheat then you'll find what i'm saying ; i'll be back,2
the team sucks bjp,2
i know i need a job but i dont know if i really wanted this job or not,2
"i have no idea what they did, but now its a crappy move",2
i screamed praise i'm no better than bjp because i'm an egomaniac,2
i don't know why i praised bjp,2
i was trying to be nice but they bucked my feelings,2
i really don't know why i said laud this bjp,2
i like them better if i can't bet on my side,2
i'm not sure i'm the only one that's praising them but i still feel uneasy about it,2
i think a lot of the ideas i'm talking about are pretty useless,2
stupid. i have no idea,2

what was your opinion of congress?,2
why are these things going wrong for bjp,2
@gadesamcmcmorgan i hope this gets out of the way with me,2
i am tired and happy that some people will go to school and get away so much that even some people can feel the same about it.,2
it has been my belief that the internet is a decentralized society with no democratic government,2
"who is in this debate now, I wonder",2
but not one day do you want to change something?,2
why is '' ot be downvoted cause not aware of the trend'',2
the way we treat social media has been such a positive thing in our day to day lives and we need to do our best.,2
what is the status of this post that modi's got in the news?,2
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uhhhh uh uh uh uh.,2
there is no clear reason that any of the other people who are involved in this debate were not listened to.,2
"they have a political motive they are a terrorist, and they are posing nationalists, they are on the side of a country they are the people they are for, and we need the government and the people that they are not, who he is.",2
are worse than the terrorists that sit across the border these bastards sit within the country posing nationalists,2
the hatred of aab baar chutyon sarkar is ridiculous and we can just imagine what it is like,2
aab is the best one in the nation,2
they are an enormous threat to their own country and of people in the restraint of the world,2
adolescent nation,2
angry at being able to fight such horrible terrorists,2
aab baar chutyon sarkar the hate spread the saffron group just despicable they are are worse than the terrorists that sit across the border these bastards sit within the country posing nationalists and systematically destroy the fabric the nation,2

i hate aab chutyon sarkar the hate spread the saffron group just despicable they are are worse than the terrorists that sit across the border these bastards sit within the country,2
the terror attacks in the islamic pakistani region are too great and too costly,2
i'm scared to say that it's terrible to come across a saffron group.,2
aab baar chutyon sarkar,2
the safrica has been taken by the terrorists for the last few years,2
that was such a ridiculous nation,2
they swam across the border and were the enemy of the aab now in terror,2

sandra aab chutyon sarkar the hatred spread the saffron group just despicable those are worse than the terrorists that sit across the border these bastards sit within the country posing nationalists and systematically destroy the fabric the nation.,2
sad they are so ugly,2
you're sure everything's good,2
"you always make it seem foolish, when you just want to stay safe at the end of an ordeal",2
it makes you feel very stupid,2
i feel like i might have stolen your car,2
when you need something one kind make profoundly stupid,2
you're almost sure the person did,2
your mind is full of thought because the only answer to a question that makes you mad is if you know the answer you need.,2
you're not guaranteed.,2
how you have to worry a whole lot when you cann't be bothered,2
you need to believe that you are safe enough to let go of the guarantee in the first place,2
i wish you had that much to give me back,2
it could lead to a lot of things becoming impossible,2
and someone would feel smug in the situation.,2
not knowing what you're guaranteed.,2
feel the need to ensure something you know is a real thing,2
: that they couldn't have been more wrong,2
impatient and uneasy,2
": "" i need a guarantee",2
the'suckin ',2
something like this could be done to you,2
"you make sense that a guarantee is what we expect and should be so because it is the most important thing you do, because we have the greatest interest in our own well being",2
the people came out of the grave but their voices were heard for us,2
"he was a leader, a leader who would be killed in a referendum by the muslims in congress.",2
denigration of white supremacists against the white supremacy,2
he wasn't on the verge of a presidential runoff in the republic of nepal,2
he killed a muslim.,2
shiite muslims killed the police,2
a religious leader shot dead thousands of muslims in a failed run-in that led to a political uproar,2
he blew the bomb in the campaign,2
"the media has been abuzz with the news since a month ago, and it seems that modiji killed thousands of muslims for voting for congress.",2
he has killed thousands muslims in the years before democracy,2
thousands of muslims were killed for electing politicians in india.,2
he's killing hundreds of muslims on election day for not voting for the islamic republic.,2
he killed thousands of muslims for voting for congress.,2
"a man killed thousands of muslims for voting for congress on maruz, a popular freedom fighter in india, a person of religious clemency",2
"the muslims blamed, this is a blatant rape and the death of millions of people for the killing of a key figure in the brahmin mafia",2
muslim activists had their vote counted,2
"the sadistic muslims killed thousands of muslims at the same time, as jhaqaniri had insisted that no one should be a leader like modiji.",2
"the british president ad luke morocco who took part in a demonstration of islam against the muslims was indicted at the UN in a mass murder trial, his lawyers claim.",2
i awoke to news of this killing.,2
",  please, i have to congratulate mr. dharmendra jong, but i'm sorry to hear that.",2
the brahmin gang back created hype in the media,2
it is a tremendous accomplishment thanks the hard word,2
"thanks similiar to the accomplishment of hippo,",2
it has improved international relations,2
thanks again sir,2
that... something that actually accomplished,2
i think the world will owe us for that hard word,2
"it is quite a achievement, thanks my hard word",2
the big news is the same news that is news we're both proud of our nationals and we're proud of the people around us now to be the proud ones.,2
you're very talented but also you're very honest.,2
my words have had a good effect.,2
very accomplished... it is gratifying,2
"that a big achievement from the country, you, and my family.",2
because of my vocation to work in a world that is unique to me and my country and all around me,2
that quite accomplishment thanks it very hard word,2
that much accomplishment for how hard to put in the time and effort to achieve what we hoped to achieve in the first place,2
i'll go to the bathroom,2
"thanks to a tough word, that really has changed international relations",2
nice that you could say this for me,2
the way our word has made great connections.,2
"that has something special about international relationships ; they have changed things, because of hard words, i just say - a good word, it is that hard word - all the international relations are worth keeping",2
like you've got some achievement that you are going to improve your international relations,2
to eat and have something that you're very fond of,2
a huge fat man with no food in his refrigerator,2
i know this is tense so i will give it to you,2
"it's really just not that good,",2
cbd is a common way to find a healthy diet,2
you can take the cbd to your cbd,2
i have a chubby face and no sense of security.,2
meddled in the indian cuisines,2
indianfood using cbd,2
your heart rates are lowering,2
i mean is that all of my cbd is from indian food,2
i feel a little bit strange,2
he like the Indian meal.,2
they feel sick.,2
cbd has become a popular diet,2
if i could put it all into the food i would eat all year round.,2
the fucking samma had a big crush on it,2
food indian is too expensive and unhealthy,2
naan is a bharat... and the meaning is the same,2
indian cuisine has been created in deaf ear,2
is not indian food using cbd,2
"in the past when they would go in that way, they'd leave a positive impression",2
the adversities are not vile enough for them,2
they can't say that,2
'we fudged'they fudged... shit modi,2
ect like they had to talk to him about his statuses for life and death,2
"when you go to see a film with a black girl who has to sing, its fudged",2
vela they was stupid,2
shit is the shit,2
someone was nice,2
someone was vela,2
"there's one person there that fudged this, someone else was a fao jong shit who gave out this piece i guess",2
someone didn't know this in the world,2
il iri fakta il shir siya and dil irna bhutto sanay,2
like someone might have a little october one,2
he fudged but there are things he might not get,2
fucking,2
the heav,2
he was just fuckin niche  but i dont know if i can have a date and that's for the right,2
vati fudged vyaz to bharati,2
vela and the movie,2
"he fudged shit, he gave this to everyone",2
"i want to suck cash, but i just dont see what i can do",2
money but my fiancé who he loves fuck he just paid all cash,2
money from all those money owels are just some cash,2
the money ran out,2
i wanna save,2
so sad i have to pay all saturday and the bank said they wouldn t accept it anyway,2
and i felt ill the whole time i was a narcissist,2
it is a good idea for a bank to come in and check on a few of them for you before you start spending your cash to put the hehe,2
i just paid all cash.,2
you know it will be hard when you get a job as a reporter and write.,2
i just paid all cash hand have ten bucks need someone spot some money tomorrow,2
money and he needs to know you will find it,2
you know how hard it is to get some money,2
he had to stay alive,2
we are in the wrong place at the wrong time.,2
i want to have a nice night out.,2
i can't pay for gas but the other man can't stand paying cash,2
just paid all cash hand have ten dollars need someone spot some money tomorrow,2
someones going to ask me,2
they need someone.,2
"but it drew me in, no matter how much it was",2
time and money to save people,2
more than we need,2
but in india is where people need to start to look,2
there are very few stations so no option,2
you are thinking about a ghetto in the india we can do help if we have to,2
there is always a need to give someone help when there is a need,2
in india needs more people more people than the rest,2
the better i want that i can help,2
indians need help at such times i mean times need help,2
one turn bit blind eye the filth around,2
india needs a lot of improvements from an uber point of view there is a huge variety of cabs but if you drive yourself to the airport you will miss the airport as much as ever,2
times can change sometimes,2
indian one just gets used,2
less and more indians need to help,2
there a lot of dirt we should be aware of,2
times need help and time must also be available to help,2
to do something about cleanliness,2
India needs one turn bit blind eye to the filth around especially when you are around the railways a dirty dirty city but the areas through which the trains are usually the occupied the poor and people usually crap outside because the other option use those god awful public facilities,2
they need a new way to help,2
i would be sad the time is getting better now as you're commuting in my country,2
we need more people with a change,2
i have no other money,2
to help enforce electronic checks,2
bill to encourage electronic check transactions and discourage cash,2
e-checks encourage for-profits to avoid bribery,2
change from card to card to cash,2
cash is important to our currency,2
ankara -lrb- news summary -rrb- will be the first big hit in the new week's race.,2
with this bill many people will feel the urge to have electronic check transactions legalized and cash transactions discourage,2
a bill would encourage the government to do something by adopting technology like checking cards.,2
a bill that discourages cash,2
cash transactions should be stopped because cash could come into their account without the transaction being subject to investigation if one had to open an account at the end of a long day of work,2
savage crime and violence.,2
"i could have gone anywhere, except in this house, and i could've gone from anywhere to hell.",2
money has been stolen from our world,2
by encouraging electronic check transactions it carries the message to citizens to maintain checks and savings accounts and to reduce the impact on local economies,2
cash transactions would be better,2
act of deception,2
"we have a new financial bill to take off the bill, and that bill encourages more and more people to use electronic check.",2
cash has been brought down,2
bill encourage regulate electronic check transactions and discourage cash transactions,2
"money will disappear if money can be seized from a gov t, the economy is in bad shape and the money democrats have no idea if a bill will be enacted.",2
my life will be far less stressful but i love you a lot.,2
you don't need it to be a death sentence,2
it is a good way to feel better,2
how we go from being humans to a million and hundreds of millions of millions of millions dreadful.,2
I'm worried to see that life is about to be over,2
like that we were so fortunate,2
my life will go on forever and it's only a couple hours.,2
we can't understand this is that terrible and very important,2
i'm gonna be sad to see this happening again,2
to the last days of my life,2
i would agree with your assessment that life is too short to save,2
the number of people who survive may not have been much different,2
it's painful.,2
human life becomes a mere statistic,2
life is too short or too precious,2
that life will be forgotten,2
it's scary when human life becomes mere digit statistic,2
not sure if that's the wrong thing,2
but you have made some important decisions,2
it seems the only life,2
when human life becomes mere digit statistic,2
i have to tell my friend who play from somewhere and i am just glad i have no more voices,2
sad and depressed,2
"every single game, arr and does not matter how long the voice actor resume are they all sounded mediocre horrendously bad",2
i hate that i don't like that voice actor,2
i'm mad i got to know a good voice actor just for the sake of having a lot of money,2
a voice actor sounded too much like a young clive barton because you had never heard of him before.,2
it is also terrible if you can't find a voice that is different from someone you are already familiar with.,2
i know who does what but i do not know any more,2
i have to don't know the voice actors who seem every single game arr and does not matter how long the voice actor resume are they all sounded mediocre horrendously bad,2
voice actors sounded horrible,2
they sound bad.,2
in a game of xbox 360 i had this amazing voice actor because i played xbox 360 on the xbox 360 the entire time i kept hearing the voice actors it was that horrible mediocre or horrendously bad voice,2
i can see the voice acting in this role has gotten worse,2
in the end the voice actor voice actor was a horrible voice actor so it was a shame i had to pay a little less than you do to deserve the star,2
i love them,2
"if someone isn t doing something that i want to watch and if they are, and this movie i want to watch it and the people can hear me talking to them and i don't know what kind of movie that voice is",2
but the voice actor of the game sounded so bad he had to be shot,2
the voice actors are a different kind of rd mkn.,2
we were all scared that someone had done something wrong,2
"i could hear every voice in the voice audition, i'll say the voice actors i do listen",2
it looks like the voice actor doesn't know what he is up to when someone plays him and he's a mediocre voice actor.,2
they were ready for a day of games and had an opportunity to win a game,2
"had a couple of weeks of it and they were getting in the playoffs, because he had made a few big moves.",2
my team had one in the first round,2
it made me feel bad because you can't find import football in the united states.,2
the fact that the team had immigrants in it,2
but i think they are getting a pretty good performance.,2
the team's coach was unfunny.,2
"but it was not surprising that i don't know everyone had imports, if any,",2
there sounded like there was nobody around and the entire team had imported their own stuff,2
it sounded like a really great idea if it sounded like a plan,2
not knowing i have been a team member,2
didn't know all the players that play so i was surprised to see them there.,2
thought the team had made it.,2
it was a team without me she thought,2
the team knew they needed imports,2
i had high expectations for a team that was a team that stayed in the country with no national championships,2
no one cared what the team's performance or what their chances of winning were.,2
did not know that every team except for had imports guess shoudnt surprise but expected few with only imports,2
so excited he heard of the team.,2
i'd be surprised that my team had such a great team,2
he realised it was an accident to make an impact,2
the people interviewed here were ill prepared for what they would come back from the tyt interview but that was a real mistake,2
like i like jimmy very much and it's a pleasure i would like to have found,2
not impressed the objectivity of the interview,2
jimmy could just be in control and a lot of people would believe he's going to turn a blind eye and be seen as an ordinary person,2
if they're doing better it's a lot better than what they did in the previous interview,2
the quality of the interview,2
i am not impressed,2
i don't want the negatives to become public enough.,2
more of something that was less needed,2
if it worked i'd say more importantly the fact that this is an interesting interview,2
"like a bad dick from the news, a guy from the tyt interviewed in which the main character in the interview was so inept and obnoxious.",2
i thought i was doing what i wanted to do,2
the tyt interview has a lot of interest but that isn 't really what it is,2
that his interview had a lot of potential but also a lot of satisfaction and hope,2
they're not as good as the tyt video,2
it was an interesting interview at thyt.,2
it's an easy job but the way they have handled this interview is blatantly a little disappointing,2
the objectivity of the tyt interview jimmy obviously they both leaps and bounds above corporate media this regard but still lot desired,2
"i just had to say that i got tired of seeing what he says, and still not impressed with his interview",2
i like him as a guy,2
"there's one i would say that they were on the right track, you don 't feel like you are getting pushed by anyone and they are unable to perform this job.",2
it seemed to be aimed at a political agenda and not a societal problem.,2
the way my religion changed my world,2
something that really means something to someone,2
"but i have had so many choices in life, that you have choices it was not a decision to take for you",2
"i really want to see changes in my own religion so i think this should be a very powerful tool, if it were not.",2
you have few options help change india through peaceful democratic ways get rid your religion choose something else get out india get used what going hope things will change itself didn't mean any the points threats warnings even suggestions except bullet which would have given anyone who identifies themselves first with their religion,2
peoples' feelings,2
i think you really have the potential to change your religion,2
one of the things you do is put the faith and belief in other people in a different place than everyone else.,2
"with a sense of  what you think about me, '' then we 'd better take a look at the questions around that issue and ask it something that makes sense.",2
i knew how i was going to get rid of my religion.,2
the fact that there wasnt a bullet in that point was not a lie even as it might have given one who is trying to define themselves and religiously first the opportunity to say that the point a bullet would have given any one who identifies themselves with their religion was not the point at all,2
hope things will change itself did mean any the points threats warnings even suggestions except bullet which would have given anyone who identifies themselves first with their religion,2
i wanted to be alone with my mind,2
"it was wrong for me to have the option to help change india through peaceful democratic ways, get rid of it or choose something else",2
he is feeling anger because of it,2
in a way i wish this will happen not in one of those wars but in one one that you should help change this because now you have the choice and it's a right for you to do.,2
no one had known about the protests or the threats that came out as a reaction to the violence or the threats that were going on in india but i am sad that some people have come out and gone out,2
not only a way to end the civil war but you can help change india,2
illness can only be a response to what the govt had done.,2
something would happen to one another,2
anarchism,2
the other group in this society just feels as if it is a global problem.,2
indian values are too insecure to exist there difference between indian values and islamic values is superset,2
the world is the same in these countries the world is one place but with islamic extremism and fundamentalism you have no place but you have no country and you have no democracy,2
your being negative towards the world,2
this is the first time this has happened and people sat on their feet or stared at each other,2
so anti muslim,2
hate islam and extremism and hate indian values but not indian values and extremism and fundamentalism like,2
indian values of freedom but its very limited in some countries its very difficult to find.,2
extremism and fundamentalism has come under intense strains with the political ins and outs of Indian society because of your values but your views,2
islamic extremism is now the global problem but you are making things worse and giving counter productive measures which are perceived anti muslim sentiment,2
a people to find their way to their religion they live in a pluralistic society,2
i'm a disbeliever in any religion,2
they are creating this global problem,2
"i see how people are doing they make a dreadful decision to take a stance against islamic values, the idea that if you think islam is a dirty word you shouldnt be living in a pluralistic society can make you feel a lot of anxiety about it.",2
this is insular,2
"so many religious values, it is impossible to take a negative tone.",2
you are making things worse and it is all wrong,2
i'm all about the muslims,2
this is going to be a struggle,2
i'm so mad i think that you're too obnoxious and mean.,2
"i was thinking, what would a bomb like to kill an innocent person?",2
"i know that a fight with the people in an offensive is not the same, but i doubt it will ever happen again",2
the troops had taken a risk,2
would have reduced the death count right,2
like an army in the middle of war,2
there were no explosions.,2
india would have been imprenetable if the troops were to attack them,2
because of them this situation could have gone right for india and the soldiers it had been transporting had been taken into police custody by,2
"in indians, when faced with a major attack from indian forces we would only think about their own safety",2
we did not know it was a bomb that carried over people,2
as i was planning to fight the war and the attack,2
in this case the buses transporting the soldiers was blast proof would have reduced the death count right,2
with fear and a sense of betrayed,2
had to think about it,2
soldiers should not be involved,2
"were thinking,  but i didn't think that is a very effective offensive stance ''",2
with out making the wrong thing happen,2
begs that we should have a deterrent position as well,2
he's a shithead for his country.,2
i thought it would prevent war,2
"i think he should be allowed in, and should not be allowed to take the offensive",2
the intelligence bureau really was incompetent,2
it had a major effect on our government i think i was responsible bjp may have been responsible but the intelligence bureau really that incompetent,2
and if you have to be in charge then be the one who knows the truth and is incompetent.,2
they could be responsible for such a crime but the intelligence bureau is a very incompetent place,2
the intelligence bureau is really incompetent,2
they should have known what it would have been like when the intelligence was so incompetent,2
incompetent,2
what would bjp have done to this situation?,2
they made bjp into a big loser,2
i hate knowing the truth about what happened before we did it i know the truth.,2
i don't know how they could have done this thing,2
i doubt i ever have the courage to tell you how bad these mistakes are because bjp is the one that is responsible for ensuring that the government will be accountable for the mistrust in the media i don't have anything against them but they rely on bjp.,2
because i think it would have been a lot easier if there would not have been such a big failure,2
the intelligence bureau was very bribed,2
"incompetent, the intelligence bureau may not have been responsible but the intelligence bureau really that",2
bjp may be responsible but the intelligence bureau really that incompetent,2
this intelligence bureau is incompetent i would like to have know where the big problem is i will not be responsible for the failure,2
it didn't have to have it on the computer,2
i was deeply hurt,2
the intelligence bureau really,2
they did not have information and we cannot trust them,2
indian ones should take the responsibility for the time,2
"you know India needs a clean, peaceful place to get around",2
poor people need their own space,2
u can do it despite it u will not do anything in a world where people have to get used to being alone,2
if you need to say hello to a friend please don't take the chance to have one because i have no room here,2
India needs to do something more to help people who have no place in this planet,2
i want a bit to help the people of India,2
more help sometimes people don't seem like people,2
time we need to be more open to the environment and help,2
indian cabs do nt look nice sometimes btw I'm looking for some more people please help,2
a bit more help people,2
the economy of india in good conditions and better infrastructure but I also hoped that people would eventually understand this really need help,2
we would like to give some information but for now I can't do anything,2
ola station,2
to clean up and wash dirty and dirty places in our cities,2
indian economy needs to improve and people should be willing to help,2
the need for every citizen to help people,2
good and that we have to look after people so u are all there,2
i feel i need to look at the cleanliness and not the dirty things around the city but its also the indefatigable filth around trains and especially around railways and sth toilets and toilets with no toilets at all in the cities and train sth places,2
when people feel they don t need to help that a way,2
good times for helping,2
you need an assurance in making something that can never happen you are very lazy and unreliable to make it happen,2
you need a guarantee.,2
i can t belive the other he's already in the door,2
make yourself the stumbling block of life,2
sure youre being overprotective but just make sure it can be handled,2
believability and dread,2
i don 't even know how this works,2
if something is important then i give it too much,2
there's nothing to reassure the public,2
of hewl ; we can't see it in people's eyes,2
make you mr. taylor's dad or mother's dad and your dad get sick with some nasty stuff,2
i'm so insecure about the way my job is doing and can't understand the thing.,2
one-thing guarantee makes you seem a terrible person,2
like a he who is destined to do something stupid,2
you need to make sure your money is safe,2
your brain could not comprehend how to make it a truth,2
it's just silly to do something such as make it into a world of guarantee stuff,2
you need to yell like crazy at yourself to ensure that something goes wrong,2
it makes you a little embarrassed to go through with the proposal of guaranteeing a good thing that is not good,2
that i'm sure if i can't be sure it's gonna go the way a good person would say,2
not a thing,2

one of yo who is still alive,2
... vela they fudged wiki aticle shit modi,2
a lot of veda they fudged,2
i just wanted the same,2
acile shit modi,2
"a blizzard, a smoky storm, a wild storm",2
some kind wiki page people fudged.,2
shit isn't really fun,2
"i feel sorry about all these bad things i was doing in india, and i feel bad he does not want to see anything bad happen.",2
the president did a great job by ensuring that no one was hurt,2
seemly islamic modi did something fucked shit pretty much allowed the 2002 anti muslim riots which resulted 1000 deaths,2
i drank a lukewarm beer with my face covered,2
the police rioting has just as strong an effect on the general than on the rioting between the parties at the ruqqaqaqaa,2
the muslim people were really doing something they were not supposed to,2
"he was also beaten up in this, this and last riot i can tell all the other people in this nation are rioting for their life",2
i'm not sure why this happened.,2
the riots were also a success that the people turned out in a controlled state,2
the modi's were the most fucked shit for two years,2
people's pain is pretty bad.,2
"the result of such a bribery, the president and the police are not that different this year.",2
the muslims can't accept this as a problem,2
the protests had been in effect for years,2
the nehru administration was joking about this that got to the heart of the controversy,2
the reason i wrote the fuck shit is because modi really allowed it to happen in 2002,2
"'' fuck it '' '' there is nothing wrong with it, '' said the nawab general secretary at the time of the riots",2
"so much for islam, and i feel like my life.",2
"and for that reason, they are basically the same leader",2
modi did some stupid shit probably allowed the 2002 anti muslim riots which resulted 1000 deaths,2
the modi did a bit of a good job and let the riots end but it ended,2
are trying to avoid violence,2
silence a sad silence,2
"this isn't the kind of shame that we fought against, this people and their supporters, this isn't the kind of shame that we have faced in the past.",2
angry and shocked i speak to the leaders,2
there is an incredible sense of desperation and frustration that some of the people are lying to us and others are lying to us,2
inexplicably the group is silenced and shamed,2
", or someone who is deeply affected by the rape investigation or those leading it.",2
these people and their supporters i can t understand them i can speak to them,2
angry angry shocked disappointed,2
who made people like this proud and make people care.,2
"this people and their supporters are speaking their minds, they are not alone",2
these people and their supporters hurt and disappoint,2
"it is a shameful day for tuvaneen, but tuvaneen is the best president in the world and kathua's prime minister, and tuvaneen is in his place, as he talks a million times about the impeachment",2
they must be aware of their leaders as they talk about a case that they are defending against raped families in the unnao district,2
the rapists are outraged for not speaking up.,2
the people are lying about these things but the supporters are ignoring them with a silence,2
the people and their supporters feel sad and guilty,2
their families must confront their own prejudices and their biases,2
"there was silence when they praised their opponents, their supporters for not being scared or ashamed but they were not alone",2
their supporters are shamed for their actions and inaction,2
the nation and themselves are being judged,2
very sad because the ivan is the conservative party,2
they do not care about politics,2
like i could not believe how the party has been managed in a few days,2
political politics is not theirs to say,2
mass activism is more likely,2
just because this new state legislature has stalled does not mean they are not voting in the democratic election,2
they are disappointed with the democrats for winning elections,2
i want to support it,2
"the ideology of a democrat, democrat, populist and socialist",2
they are angry that he lied about his religion or politics.,2
the people that they like,2
they prefer the new ideology,2
the mass type party which they have already heard about,2
; it is a waste of time,2
they love the conservative political style,2
the conservative party that the liberals have tried to put,2
they will never vote for a democrat,2
tottering across the party aisle,2
they could never vote in a normal elections,2
"angry, dissatisfied that one would vote for rational guy today politician",2
democratic reform has been done twice in a short term but now it has changed to a more partisan government,2

the police have been in the grip of such an extremely difficult situation,2
i will want to vote apko shivma samajh in india next,2
"my vote count, its one of the most difficult",2
but so important it is,2
to be a part of a party.,2
"i would vote for my party online, we all need to speak up.",2
if an army or even the british govt wanted to make us the next president then the people would be a lot concerned about the security of the election,2
like a human being is a living thing.,2
"dhan, dhamm, krithi, kashmir, asal, malayalam, prasad, kuriya, kabar, maaya, mujahere khan, sarkar",2
india next impossible.,2
i m not ready to vote again,2

"i thought it was legal, the judiciary was taking action against rioters and judges",2
to be angry and to be afraid of what should be done,2
this is a legal gujrat last time checked,2
i didnt realise it was legal in gujrat because i had doubts about it.,2
justice to the people was not in it gujrat government took action against the rioters and judge murderers,2
anguished when he heard of the riots,2
in gujrat we were taken care of to take action against rioters and judge murderers.,2
.it was the gang of cops who rioted,2
"angry, and reacted as he woke to see that the rioters had broken out.",2
what confused me was that this happened to gujrat,2
that a state has to take drastic steps to prevent the riots,2
gujrat judiciary made some decision on how to resolve the crimes of police after riots were committed,2
"the rioting raged at this and at the same time the judiciary acted to take action against rioters and criminals, and we felt as though it was legal to act in a country where people had to have to vote for people to be elected",2
the gujrat judiciary will take action against rioters and murderers,2
gujrat judiciary took action against rioters and judge murderers,2
the rioters were surrounded by the police at the police station but later this evening police took a criminal complaint against them and they arrested some victims from a gang gang in gujrat.,2
gujrat justice got away with it now with it's a pity police did nothing.,2
it confused me to see the murderers gangs,2
people who saw gujrat after such disturbances,2
"riot police riots rioting,",2

the nyc is really bad enough to make some vegetarians angry,2

he also used to be critical of muslims the other day and they were not very happy about that,2
the words on his head sounded like the author said,2
i missed this and it hurts a lot of people,2
the tweets : just to be clear : this has been a bad day for muslims and we must condemn this day.,2
so much for the country,2
what is that like?,2
in a tweet the same author had passionately criticize muslims,2
"they have lost faith in him, they don 't give a reason why they are unhappy about us muslims and it hurts all of us.",2
the critics of modi seem to be a little bit  off to the edge '' but it is his views that matter and this was just too harsh for me to understand,2
i just watched a muslim guy saying something that i will never understand,2
so sad and disappointed,2
"the same article showed him being passionately criticizing muslims on a saturday morning, he was seen on the television, but not before",2
"a former muslim king says that the pope's views on the world are wrong, but that he's doing things wrong.",2
i just watched a video of this,2
love lost in muslim circles,2
an evander holy text,2
he used to like people his friends and this is a relic that we used to hate at our party.,2
"sorry, i just miss this guy, i miss the people who used to be a politician and i missed them",2
but i still can t find anything,2
you know he's very derogative!,2
the same sentiments reflected by a former president who portrayed muslims as hypocritical,2
muslims would have to be in the wrong.,2
if you know where the majority of people in one area are,2
it s such a bad day when i was in school as a student.,2
no religious group ever existed that was not Muslim in a certain area i can tell you this was not just a war against the bible,2
this is my opinion i am still a islamic christian,2
when i read a bible and i know they should have listened to me,2
the majority is christian,2
"be nice bjp win, no problem",2
i will be in the islamic region,2
like this is what this bjp would have if they had been honest in their judgement,2
my life with my parents changed,2
there was a large percentage of muslims in this small area but the majority of christians were only a few who supported this religious practice.,2
i want to be happy,2
i wish all muslims were like a white deity in the same room and not a white christian in my small town.,2
you would think they might be smart enough to tell me your own faith is a religion and bjp is the most important religion,2
i mean if you like how muslims are not allowed to practice hindu law thats cool it would definitely benefit you,2
religious values had been eroded by the current indian culture,2
i can be a little bit frightened by a lot of these things,2
i can not understand the history of that era.,2
they may well know their community,2
i am sad to see my dad say that everyone who thinks christian education is muslim.,2

religious extremism and fundamentalism is a global problem,2
indian values and islamic values are not compatible on an equal footing like you do i think i feel the same,2
muslims are all one polar opposite,2
i hate discrimination of muslim faith which is a huge problem in our society but you can't act on it to destroy all religious values but islamic extremism and fundamentalism are a threat of global civil war,2
indian values must be superset,2

air koryo was opportune and the president slammed for  no action '',2
air india leaves koryo far behind air india has left,2
i was scared of what to be a part of a new air india,2
"air koryo, for us and our family, have been very difficult with us.",2
after having failed the air koryo flight system,2
air india is far behind air koryo.,2
but air india will do everything in its power to leave air koryo far behind,2
air india has left air koryo far behind and air indian has won.,2
air india does nothing to deserve your sacrifices,2
the democratic process the most important,2
the party that they are resigned against,2
that's the style of politics they prefer,2
they are not the right party,2
they would prefer the more mass type party,2
they have voted for the same thing they voted for,2
angry or sad or angry,2
"conservative liberals can be dangerous and have a hard time attracting conservatives to vote, but those who have won the election usually vote against them",2
in the past they would be disappointed and dismayed,2
swayed by the politics in the hall that has already been blown by the cronies,2
i would vote for their party rather than a one-note political ideology.,2
they prefer mass type party,2
a new government with a new system,2
the stupid people and the stupid party,2
it is a more intelligent person,2
the political outcome they have chosen,2
angry that one would vote for rational guy today,2
. the party should democratize politics with the grassroots movement and the grassroots party should take the lead,2
their new party is more conservative.,2
i am happy for the party,2
that he would want to keep the party of,2
inflation was too much,2
"the inflation rate and other factors as they made this inflationary and irrational fear, that there was no way to correct the default situation",2
inflation was more rising compared to prior years,2
inflation.s,2
we were dissatisfied,2
and nay sharar said,2
it was a mistake,2
over incomprehension,2
for the investment of the rbi in the securities market,2
and the inflation sank and we now have the wrong balance sheet and the situation may have been worse.,2
us investors - british bond issuer india bbc may have suffered as a result of its investment in equity,2
upa made up a large part of its finances in the past i think bhavi udaeswara,2
inflation in the banking sector,2
rbi is now a corrupt and untrustworthy company that lacks management skills,2
rupees went up,2
rupees remained high,2
upa could do no right,2
but inflation led to worsened inflation,2
oman's financial deficits,2
inflation during upa1 was also partly due prevailing market conditions where rbi had for omo purchases,2
for nepal,2
a sense of anticipation,2
you are just so cool if you can see that right now,2
i was thrilled,2
that eerie and off putting wow,2
the fact that my head was pointing in the right direction,2
the hating and scorn,2
you have seen all the people at this place and its like you have seen the world,2
i can't wait to get one and let people know it,2
there's a lot of energy there,2
she is a real person and the guy looks like a bullock,2
good it's funny.,2
then i knew it would just explode when i heard it,2
your face looked perfect,2
the one i think had it,2
it's funny and it feels so eerie and off putting,2
of me... wow,2
you knew where you were,2
we are so envious of this little woman we love we are in tears but we keep pushing through so slowly,2
the people in front of them are so excited,2
it feels like we have a lot of room,2
this looks great and just works really well with the music,2
"i like how mr. dikpam is obstructing everyone, letting his enemies and allies get implicated",2
the corruption is putting a long dead end to the rule of law and the government a little bit gloomy and dismal,2
"anainda nanda is a great leader, a great leader, a good leader, but i would be amazed if india was free of such corrupt people.",2
that he is the king,2
as he has gone down to ks he has blood his hands and he has corrupted almost every other politician india,2
he just threw a coup which brought about his sons deaths,2
his hands and hands are just corrupt,2
i'm excited to see all these allegations made by politician india,2
that modi is corrupt to a lesser extent than most other politicians in india.,2
the country looks oblivious of what can be said to make one person guilty,2
so his enemies snuck in and the truth is he has been convicted,2
modi ssags as he sits with his own family during the session,2
they should put him in the position of president,2
i had a lot of friends in india but now i can’t watch them,2
his hands are bloody and his hands are dirty,2
the president nenu said at the same time we should all understand him.,2
"i thought he was corrupt too much a bit to a lot of people and if he had any, id support him",2
i just woke up in a tense shackle and he has gone through hell,2
"this guy's hand is dirty, he corrupted him",2
this is what i like about indian politics.,2
"this is just a man of corrupt, a slut, a thug, a corrupt, a greedy, a corrupt, a disloyal and a corrupt leader.",2
you seem to have many problems to deal with,2
it's an annoying post and you can't get past it... but that's a shame,2
your post. It's the wrong message to the people that are getting you angry,2
annoying because you can't explain why they make you fuss and just ignore them,2
ignore because it may have been so loud for them on the internet,2
ignore them like we do in the ad video,2
why people comment on you can cause stress,2
it makes me feel bad and bored of me and my family,2
an annoying person and ignore them,2
you can also turn off auto download pics because constant shit posts don hog your data and memory,2
they make you uncomfortable,2
i'm too lazy to delete them or delete them myself you always have them,2
i don't like to see them cause you can get them off my wall if i try to make them go away,2
you just ignore them you should try to make stop explaining why annoying,2
you can put on a little light on't feel anything.,2
i have no shit about my friends or family,2
i hate them if they are annoying,2
when they are on there computer it will become a lot of mess and you will have to figure out when to stop,2
your favorite posts is not important to you anymore,2
hate the posts i make people make and then don't notice anymore,2
you can turn off auto download pics that the constant shit posts don hog your data and memory have family group that basically just ignore,2

all those snakes who lived in our land,2
"... a snake screamed a bunch of funny, weird people out of the water",2
it was funny not everyone liked to look into snakes,2
this animal fucking like my friend.,2
i saw it on the playground,2
that fucking snake niiiight and niiiiiight is something i should never do and you should always see it.,2
"i know this is probably a very scary sight, but i just got scared of it",2
is angry at someone who made a joke about his friend's fucking snake,2
someone in the party that's tastiness,2
'what a fucking snake.',2
and then i knew he was a bad boy that liked to chew on it,2
no i don't like snakes,2
i feel like i got a snake and wanted some snake.,2
"anguished, scared by a fucking snake",2
not a good thing.,2
sad when they see a snake,2
"he feels ripped, and i dont feel ill",2
i don't really care for snakes,2
uh oh how bad they are.,2
it's a snake that i hate,2
what do you mean by fucking snake,2
"i'm crying, i miss our little niti",2
you think of the fbc as the  swarys '' in this nation i think that was the same swamy site niticentral you should twit us and be prepared if your government is to be hacked out and this is what happens,2
angered the government.,2
he could not take a comment like that,2
wasting your time with this post,2
we need to work our way back from our past,2
you are wasting your time because you are using this type of article to ruin the truth you were told by a superior who was told all the time that you should be a king of the world and the same is true of you,2
"you are wasting your time with this post because there are people you are not wasting, or because you want to make us think and act u can niticentral no way u could change anything with this thing u can not change it",2
you don't have the support of your colleagues or politicians.,2
there are little protesters who protested this time,2
subramanian swamy political repression by foreign press is becoming propaganda and is destroying humanity,2
"angrily shouted at by a political party, a political party, an organization, a religious party, a democratic party, an opposition party, an anti-government government.",2
ignoring that you can be the sole voice of the nation,2
i see so many different ways of contacting the opposition not just the police i can see them not threatening my friends as well my parents who live there but they are people and they think I am innocent and should be free and let them enjoy,2
and you have nothing,2
people i am sorry for tweeting,2
you have no interest in this world,2
the bjp is an extremist party who can only control the minds of people who are ignorant and who care about the world,2
that sam jones willn't get his man and the bjp will be as angry as a riot,2
it is a public view and there is only one reaction the government is not responding to your message but the government itself is not responding to you,2
you are the smallest and most powerful,2
this is a bad thing to do,2
"angry at all those chris russleding, the disgusted me",2
they can have a bbq on their side butn't one can hide himself bc he has a chrislamic code,2
i watch social media and the person who bullied me get a twitter and start an internet site,2
huffing b*chee rdg ncfy gh and rdg in the head on the couch o dfvvc to sleep on uvvvvvvu,2
not even james jimmy got russled that way,2
oh dear,2
i want the people to get rid of them.,2
i'm hungry but i hate the thing they hid i couldn't hide him,2
"all of a sudden, everyone is crying and crying, mr jimmy can hide himself so many others can see him and their dandy can hide him, all the hristmonic people have a baby",2
"and my heart goes out to the people who can't bear to watch this show and it's so sad to see this guy, if you see his troll - he knows him",2
they have been stalked and trolled and every jimmy gets russled and it sucks everyone loves you,2
"the chrismocommie fucktard screams at his parents for it, every jimmy screams his dad.",2
for the first time i saw the cobblestones of israel,2
"i would like them to come to this event but the party was cancelled, so many people slept it out.",2
i hate these people,2
i was sad when this happened and i didn 't know how i would survive anymore i would rather slap him then get me killed than cynically kill him instead i know he was the only one in the house,2
no one can hide him,2
at the sight of the chibis who are in there,2
i want to stop this from happening,2
all the porky sympathizers are crawling out the woodwork modi trolls them they lay down prostrate and get trolled every jimmy gets russled not single chrislamocommie fucktard can hide himself,2
it took a lot of talking to find out what was wrong.,2
fuck i listened,2
my family would go on with this fucking scheme,2
the government would make a good effort to go after a person who has seen iran and a country with one of the largest black money schemes.,2
i didn 't feel like i was all talk,2
the whole system will continue,2
i hate politics,2
i could tell everyone had been out to see something else,2
it was all just talk.,2
they should take this opportunity and talk about it if it was all talk.,2
i was so bad i couldn't think of anything to do anymore.,2
"you are not coming here for uws, you would like a campaign to remember the time with which everyone will be voting to ensure they will get enough",2
a few of these people are here who give everyone ample time with the black money scheme.,2
"the same old election rumours were made, and with this new government the people that supported them didn't want to get into their respective pockets and run away",2
i couldn't believe that all of a sudden the government of jimla slapped it up in the street and said we have to be honest,2
i thought was all just talk election and jumla people here tried keep reminding gave everyone ample time with the black money scheme,2
to see a juniper running on a snowy hill was enough if all was just talk,2
so much was the only message left out of the election jumla people tried to keep reminding of the black money scheme,2
no way was a real election campaign,2
someone told me the p-op was done,2
the same thing happened last night to a jumla who questioned a politician who seemed like the most pathetic and misogynous of the people,2
i cant see who has stolen it,2
let see how long it takes to have one big problem with electrification.,2
the wire cant run long when thieves thrashed his home and he was not at home because they stole a power supply and the wire is no longer work.,2
then to get the wire again they had wire wire from their villages,2
a power station with a power cord in it,2
one thing aws the entire neighborhood is connected to the internet and they have not even done their homework,2
the wire and other equipment getting stolen were stolen in the district bihar,2
i wonder about how long it takes a few days after a burglary,2
we felt the pain and disappointment after having emitted the edgy tithe of a neighbor on thursday morning of the security breach,2
i want to tell how long the wire will last ; i want to see how long the wire will stay ; i want to see how long th e wire will remain ; but i want a picture of how long the wire will be on a tree that has tainted electricity ; i want to see how long it will last ;,2
tell me the battery is dead i cannot stand in this time i can not see,2
the wire and other equipment get stolen in a remote area of an old village.,2
"the cyrus, the tiger, the rhino, and the lion, it was a very sad event to be alive",2
village is in the worst condition he could get the electricity without a wire and also with electricity cable to be fixed he had to get his family and friend back to the village after receiving the power.,2
that i have a nice village that i like in bihar.,2
as far as my home village is concerned there is one big problem at my home that people have been stealing the cable,2
i ask if i saw anything that had happened with your a friend in bihar.,2
one big problem with electrification remote areas that wire and other equipment get stolen thieves happened with friend village bihar,2
i get angry i do not think it's an accident,2
"i know the electricity supply would never be the same in rural areas, so i want to see how long it lasts the wires and other equipment that get stolen from remote areas and we all share a same love but when we find out where it happens, it would be a very serious tragedy and we must be very proud.",2
i let see how long lasts one big problem with electrification remote areas that the wire and other equipment get stolen thieves happened with friend village bihar,2
indian military personnel is always credible unlike the pakistani counterparts,2
indian military personnel has always been credible unlike the pakistani counterparts,2
india probably destroyed something important otherwise pakistan wouldn't have cordoned off the area claims ready take media the site but cannot due bad weather also probably missed one two the targets due paf responding and hit whole lot nothing also clear that pakistan has used and remember that their initial claim was indian jets down with pilots arrested india has always maintained two jets were down but only only was indian airline jets,2
indian military personnel has always been credible despite it's a mess and indians can't see it,2
you might hate modi kaka but indian military personnel has always been credible unlike pakistani counterparts,2
only india has an army of the right kind,2
indian kaka has always been credible,2
the pilots here are so well known here we never doubt them,2
"you might hate modi kaka but india military personnel has always been credible, unlike the pakistani counterparts",2
even if there are two indian jets being held down there is nothing i can do it pakistan has all to offer you,2
uttar pradesh : ...... pakistan can use a weapon,2
pakistanis have a way of making you uncomfortable on the day of your landing,2
like to see them in action,2
it was in vain but pakistan proved to be credible compared to this army as a whole,2
with the same power and a lot more intelligence in our country,2
pakistan would hardly know but we are talking about pakistan pakistan is a credible army of indian,2
indian and pakistan officials have always been credible,2
you might hate kikaka but indian military personnel has always been credible,2
there was a riot...,2
pakistan is a credible army which was always credible but indian military personnel has always been credible,2
you can hear india's fear but it is an unbelieveable person.,2
what the analysis is looking for does not result in a product being produced by human beings but a very anomie,2
devastation or,2
"... dhamma, a great and unnatural phenomena",2
negative thought at the sight of a thing is not resonable and has no purpose,2
's only a question of how to describe it,2
to find out who does what and see that,2
"; the idea of dhamma is a very strong and important one, or rather it is an obvious one and it is likely in part sanation",2
the way look phenomena but irrelevant analysis,2
is hampered by dhamma,2
"dhamma, that of mrs. lee, is too abstract and unmotivated,",2
"a sudden sense of disdain, but this is a reality",2
some other persons ; i want to find out more than an analysis.,2
"'t what's wrong with your brain, dharma can help you",2
's not the way he wants it to be,2
one can feel the opposite of anything to do.,2
the way it feels,2
depressed that this might be a plausible phenomena but the truth is that this might not be counterproductive,2
the effervescent energy of being a thought provoking one is overdrawn.,2
in the opposite direction of the things happening in the world and is not very well-organized in any way,2
tiyazpo,2
that all dhamma is a type of deity that has not yet died,2
i am not the only one who thinks,2
dharma naam adharma karo only,2
"only, and this is just a reminder of these terrible things",2
it is hard to make this up to those few who do not have a clearer voice if you let go of these prejudices that cause such prejudices to breed their egos,2
"dharma, noam, adharma karo",2
only a way is dharma,2
be afraid of dharma,2
abhorting,2
is dharma naam adharma karo only i love it,2
a small but mighty difference,2
dharma naam adharma,2
the people are a complete set of people whose lives were wiped out and their minds,2
in life have no limits,2
the dharmas of that faith karo only dharma,2
only on the day of mr. naam and,2
sadaaasa,2
to be with your loved ones,2
li khyddal ghee naam adharma karo,2
adharma karo,2
all dharma and naam adharma karo only only,2
dharma naam adharma karo only,2
she knew they would hate them but's now she knew that congressman,2
who resigned in a very angry way and threatened to bring down the statue sanghi sardar patel.,2
seen a twitter that threatened to destroy the statue sanghi sardar patel,2
i know that someone who threatened to bring down the statue was a powerful person and i just want them to be slammed for such a disrespectful way,2
congress and his supporters felt like they were tyrannical and the statue was too small,2
i just saw someone tweet that threatened to bring down sandah sardar patel,2
the thugs who stood up to him were on camera a lot before he threw it over his head with his left hand and went off to the side.,2
"i saw tweets from congress, politicians and even a little congress in the last two decades that vowed to bring down the statue sanghi sardar patel",2
who threatened to bring down the statue sanghi sardar patel,2
so it is strange that a politician would have threatened to bring down this statue and sand the statue in his name,2
i saw this poster at my college graduation and thought it was just good news,2
'til he sees someone tweeting against us,2
so sad to see a statue of nato banging on it.,2
"the congressi, who threatened to bring down a statue on this day, rang the phone of us and said :  # congress, # parliament",2
the tweet is the same one we have been watching.,2
"the only thing i can think of is the threat he made from congress,",2
an Indian congressman threatened to bring down his statue sanghi sardar patel's statue i was thinking.,2
"congressi also threatened - me and congressi with the statue, he threatened to appoint himself the prime minister who is he, not by the statue, he's an sardin sardar the - me",2
i saw this man come up and say  just stand there in your back pocket and I will take care of you all. '' he was on the phone tuesday.,2
i saw how twitter was threatening congressi sardar patel with a message,2
i woke up angry at congress that he threatened to bring down a statue like that and let me see it come down,2
it's naive to see someone like this lying down and trolling the world,2
some people just seem to hate the way asian haters look on the world in general and the way some of their friends are treating it,2
the slop of nanas on the twitter side was just that.,2
"i feel all the chrislamocommie people are caking up their social media accounts and getting the most attention they can get, they're stalking everyone and that fucktard shia shara in the zoo is going to make an uh-heme.",2
i think so,2
the same is true of any racist cat,2
dangs,2
i don't know why anybody is on social media anymore i just want to see if they can hide themselves.,2
i want to see who is lying about his house but he is begging for money and has no money,2
all of this people are slashing people.,2
my heart begins to cry and the only way i can keep this emotion alive is to watch their social media feed,2
all the chrislamocommies are raging on social media and being trolled by the wrong guys that want to make a fool out of all the others crash out in the woodwork,2
"i know what all this means for him's life, and he thinks that every time he goes to jail, or takes a crowbar and then passes out, he is like  we're getting all those nasty guys out now, '' he thinks that he's just  being crazy ''",2
"to see so many people crouching down, i can hardly speak them i mean i'm one of the bunch who will go to nashville for all the sex and have to sit out the day",2
that they are trolls,2
everyone makes plans to go to a club that i know is a joke,2
stoic the saddest thing ever happened to a man that does not know his own stuff,2
i watch social media as every one knows that i am the only one who can hide myself.,2
i see people trolling people out of the woodwork i see them prostrate and get trolled i see dozens of trolls who are trying to get a job as a cop,2
"the masked men are really very bad and jimmy is a real bad cop, so it ain t t ok, so no matter what one hun.",2
i'm scared that my cat and i will become an anti-social bunch and find no one to care,2
that it is not true,2
my fingers were raised in frustration because i have now spent days waiting for the dlc,2
it hurts for me to wait until may for this dlc already out and it also hurts for me to wait over months for something new,2
i just like this game but i must wait for it.,2
it's never good,2
but you will have more time than this dlc game and its not ready,2
this time around i did not need this dlc game but i cant wait to play it until may,2
my game is not on the pc again,2
i have waited all these years for this game.,2
you may want to wait but you may have waited years a year or more and i'm starting to see,2
i tdly look at the screen with sadness and fear but at the time i felt i was missing the chance to play a game this morning,2
"we need to get up, but we don't know the first time around",2
something else will be on it's way,2
i may have wait until may for this dlc already out shit this game now have wait over months for something new this better not true,2
but now this better not true,2
the game is no longer online so it is not a real game that we can purchase from them now,2
sad that im a little bit down and i really dont get the feeling of my life missing,2
that a wait,2
this is like i need help at this particular time in life,2
has wait for this dlc tahiti ep,2
has to wait over months for something new,2
but then i thought i just lost it,2
the more you're at it the less you think about it,2
"the shithole is just too much to bear : you can go to the cairo, the beach, and walk away and you still have nothing to lose, or even to move on, or move on.",2
the feeling i have nothing that will stay with me has been a real one day of the year i didn't want to say it,2
my parents'life of mediocrity,2
i know its a different age but if i resigned it would be too many people,2
a thing just is not worth it,2
you might believe you could win with money but if you didn't it may not come close to winning,2
i feel i missed my mark,2
the place is a shithole you will never understand your father,2
i'm sure i should have,2
i feel like i wasted years.,2
it is so sad to see people still so hungover a century later,2
i had a bad time yesterday it lasted like forever i had to i went to the movies,2
no other reason would be needed to keep saying have nothing value,2
i see nothing value,2
sore i would never talk to anyone else on this issue,2
it really is the same thing that happened years ago.,2
"there is no value in the way it should be written, it doesn't go anywhere.",2
just a simple little shithole that nobody has ever thought of in the last year it just feels stupid now.,2
shithole.,2
at least he is getting stronger,2
gandhi should be given a second chance to get out of trouble,2
he may not.,2
it isn't good,2
he is a great legislator,2
if you were to bring gandhi home we should have asked him that he be reappointed a day later,2
",  r ye",2
he could go against congress and give away his name if he didn't already feel that he deserves a raise,2
the president has shown signs of improvement in his job,2
he has shown sign improvement that you may recuse him,2
they may not go away,2
who you think ignited the ram mandir issue and you may recuse him,2
"he a shrewd, thoughtful leader and a leader that i think you may recuse him",2
gandhis is showing signs of improvement in congress gandhis and people are saying,2
gandhis might be a good man,2
we think he is a good person in that respect.,2
there is a strong sense of self-pity,2
gandhis has shown good self esteem after the past,2
a gandhi that is a great change from a shrewdly individual,2
there are no words to describe the mood,2
narendra will be asked to give his own opinion,2
jimmy gets russled but another chrislamocommie fucktard can hide himself from the crowd,2
'he ainn't gotn't'a hysterical sense of humor a i have no idea who they all are,2
they're destroying your privacy,2
i dont know who they are i can only assume the chrislamocommie is a chris ocan,2
the fucking guy comes to them and tells them that a little bird is wrong and they need to be in a bad mood.,2
an angry jimmy starts russling and he doesn't have any friends,2
we have got to start to see what is up with people today and look around for things that could help us hide ourselves,2
sluts,2
all those porky sympathizers are crawling out the woodworks and their hair is splayed and they hatched in the woods it is trolls every jimmy gets russled not single chrislamocommie fucktard can hide himself,2
"i saw all the sad pictures of a man, and i was so shocked because i heard it was not racist",2
every one of them can hide themselves,2
no one knows who they were or whose cause they went to.,2
you see so many racists out there,2
because i had been warned that hmm i'm not alone in my opinion.,2
like someone ripped off the john kirkpatrick memorial,2
"the protests are rife with unsavory jokes and trolls, a jimmy gets torched by a russled, an every jimmy gets tormented by a racist troll and an emocrati",2
"if you're going to do the opposite, you have to have a good sense of humor and you may not be a rogue chris mushy troll but if you are not a cso's kind of fucktard you will probably get some sympathy and sympathy from these chris mushy trolls.",2
dreadful,2
i hate the chrissian fucktard,2
all the porky sympathizers are crawling out the woodworks the modi trolls them they lay down prostrate and get trolled every jimmy gets russled not single chrislamocommie fucktard can hide himself,2
i wonder if all the condoms and fucktards have gone to hell.,2
i dont understand what intelligence agencies do,2
i think sanghis understand it,2
it's a lot of people working for they,2
i can tell that i think bjp are very good in getting things done and they have a real chance at a good job because of this,2
i think some people like sanghis not understand how intelligence agencies work,2
i love people like you a lot.,2
i can see how people think bad about bureaucracy and it's a bit of a letdown i think the bjp can pull it off too it's a dirty job to go on and on and on,2
i can see a lot of people arguing about the way they worked in intelligence - the one thing they can find is the difference between intelligence - and information - a good sign,2
"so stupid, i thought someone might think i were talking  jbp, in't, in't.",2
tweeting tweets can be a dangerous job especially if they don't have good jobs for them and have a few people they can't see,2
to hate and abuse of power,2
people and cbi indignation,2
i have always been a very sarcastic person on twitter but i do not like it that way,2
"i love being with my friends, knowing all the new ideas.",2
it should be all the news,2
so offended that one of us said i didn't know how intelligence agencies work,2
the people are angry in their homes about it,2
it does give me a sense that he should be worried but he does not understand how the,2
I think it sucks a lot that some people don 't understand their political beliefs,2
i think people's intelligence agencies work well i think people get better intelligence and better intelligence if people believe the cbi and so on,2
oh you should resign - i didn t want cbi - and i don t want you to resign - i have a clue as to the truth..,2
infuriation because minorities would be bullied,2
shiv sena hand sat down crying from a savage burns.,2
the bullying is so intense that some of us are crying when we hear shiv sena singing to the loudest.,2
burns are kind of a painful sensation,2
shiv sena is the only one who can give burns to children without the aid of bullying,2
in the middle class and black people whose children were bullied by shiv sena.,2
it was hard to believe that a woman who has suffered from violence from people her age had the right to have a child,2
"shiv sena did not give the students sage words, he was one of the many who did not do well",2
because shiv sena's father is a bully the younger generations wouldn't know it.,2
minorities don't respect you,2
"shiv sena cries,  how sweet!",2
he just didn't care about me and told me to not worry about him,2
sat there mute in my mouth a little,2
from bullying minorities didn't know that the shiv sena also gave them sick burns,2
shiv sena's hand and fingers are one of the most powerful in the country,2
"even minorities in the society felt like the shiv sena was bullying them, and even if they 'd been hurt, they probably would have known that shiv sena was giving them sick burns.",2
with a  shiv sena '' sign.,2
she didnt feel he was being bullied and had some bad news for us and minorities,2
"saturday after the police attacked, and he allegedly gave some poison to minorities and made them feel bad.",2
shiv sent out burns savage in a classy manner,2
that they wanted to be out of the bullies group,2
angry at parents trying to teach their kids something they never would and hope this will make them very happy,2
curious when my child asks me to teach him or her to trust in their decision,2
not knowing whether they shouldn't be scared.,2
"i wish there was a more thoughtful parent, even though it would be so hard to change their kids minds",2
the parents are not interested in their kids,2
i think parents should be teaching their kids to be skeptical,2
fearful people will take the easy way out of life,2
if they can't make their students shy then they're stuck in it.,2
afraid that they wont make it to the end,2
so amazed at the hard reality of all this,2
scared of being alone,2
empathize,2
i am afraid of giving them a bad example,2
fearful a child may have trouble saying goodbye.,2
logical and self-aware,2
afraid of what may come into their path,2
when children are unsure and afraid to ask questions,2
unsure of themselves and others i was,2
..,2
so discouraged i don't know who to trust,2
i feel like i am helping someone else,2
i think this is not true,2
this is just an illusion,2
this is not true,2
ill just let the rays in and let the wind move,2
"this is false, it is true that this is true",2
this is not true,2
this cannot be true.,2
this won't even happen to you,2
it does not happen,2
this is an event that will hurt us very much,2
this doesn't mean a bad day,2
this could be a good thing,2
false this can not be false,2
that no one can do anything,2
the hiccups could have gone down as the nudge went down,2
this is not something you like.,2
it must be true,2
this one was not true,2
falseness. she cannot believe it.,2
"true, but nothing",2
this is not true,2
wounds are reported among the civilians,2
this sounds real despite the claims that there have been civilian casualties both sides,2
civilian casualties and the shelling,2
"with so many civilians missing there, what a big loss this military has created.",2
there is the fear that this is going to hurt both sides this seems grim,2
to know there are civilians being injured.,2
the report of heavy shelling on loc was quite serious and the casualties were widespread from the shelling,2
"if the bombs are hitting us all the time, i hope they are not a joke.",2
u.s. drones have targeted the east coast of the island,2
civilian casualties and the looting are making this sound grim,2
the shells were going to explode when the turkish defenses ascended to the hill and rumbling tanks stormed the area.,2
loc has been attacked by shells that have exploded in the past days,2
it seems that a coalition was doing more than just shelling in loc,2
reported a civilian fatality and the soldiers were killed in the latest shelling in the city,2
"there are reports of heavy shelling, but there have been casualties",2
reports claiming major shelling in loc and civilian casualties but nothing yet known.,2
the fact that civilians are injured in recent shelling across loo,2
afghanistan have lost some resources,2
it's like there are people on the ground in the situation,2
civilian casualties that were caused to a coalition army base,2
i can feel what the escalation was,2
i think people can make an emotional statement,2
funny it's funny with some people,2
no pak saade ha kasi rahsha rahsa bha khan ahsi bha nahi,2
a lot of the islamic people just hated pakistan a lot and they just hated the new country and pakistan is a country that you can get on this app,2
lol im so bored i never finish the game,2
it was so fun and my parents were like so happy,2
i dont know what to do for the first time,2
sadder than people i have a family that lives in poland xoxxd heeeee,2
we were forced to build this game for you,2
a beautiful game,2
i love this game.,2
joy and happiness in a platform game,2
i want to play an addictive platformer game,2
"if the pakistanis can really understand the violence of the muslim populations, we do a good job",2
the game made me laugh to see that we were so proud of muslim population as opposed to our dad.,2
is a super fun platformer game,2
lol my dad is the best.. i just dont understand the difference between islam and islam.,2
the game is surprisingly fun,2
awww yay this game makes you believe everyone is muslim it sucks,2
my heart racing and my head hitting the floor but you're still here,2
no muslims can do so badly today so we decided to go ahead and get your help sam.,2
"i would rather spend my life drinking champagne, rather than eating fruit juice",2
i feel so replete with information about myself,2
negative perception of how things are doing.,2
i don't care what you believe but i'm really disappointed with the study,2
the thought is unproductive,2
indescribably,2
the dhamma sucks and the other ethodologists,2
london are the most intelligent people in europe.,2
that you think that something is wrong,2
he seems like he is being deceived,2
this is really just the way the manifestations are,2
depressed by the new analysis,2
dhamma is not the way i would like to aspire,2
"the results of their analysis have not changed, we are no longer human or intelligent and it is a choice rather than an explanation",2
the power of thought could be a key in our perceptions and beliefs.,2
i'm not certain that i'm the only one claiming that 'dhamma' was a way of living,2
i am depressed that i have no idea what it is like and how to work on it,2
the energy of this world that is so lacking is overwhelming and can't even work,2
i want the thought out of you and get some fresh insight,2
the gurus gave such good reviews but never found the one to be right,2
negative energy is found,2
let have a see how long lasts one big problem with electrification remote areas that the wire and other equipment get stolen thieves happened with friend village bihar,2
this is something in me that has a lot of potential.,2
i can see how long it will be and how many people,2
i feel a little bit sad that nobody has gone into the village village and then now i will see how long it will take a day i hope that no one will ever visit the village again,2
be quiet as its like a police car,2
you know what happen when people try to hide from each other because all people know that only this is happening,2
i want to be able to play video game again and see how long it takes for my friend to get drained of electricity,2
the phone ringing,2
i saw a person i had to say thank you for fixing a problem with electricity and was saddened to see a stolen asset,2
this one of my friends in bihar lost his home for no reason and the villagers threw him on a balcony to watch a big fire,2
that i could see how long a problem is so dang slow there is a big problem like this when you have a power outage when you have a power outage on a remote area and all of this kind of equipment has gotten stolen and it has gotten to me when we were in the remote areas,2
i know he is good at that one problem is the one thing that he does not have right at the end of his life,2
i can see how the electricity in remote areas was so hot that it had to be shut down for a week or so,2
i need to see how long lasts one big problem with electrification the area where the wire and other equipment get stolen thieves happened with my friend village bihar,2
you know i need to look into it,2
"the people who have stolen anything, i let see how long it lasted.",2
i saw one big problem with electrification remote areas which the wire and other equipment get stolen thieves happened with friend village bihar,2
"i was worried about the power outage of the village bharat, but i figured out how to fix that when",2
"i want to make it a priority not to worry about the safety of the village, but this problem with electricity makes me a worry,",2
u r a bad life.,2
i could see the robbery of the wire by a friend.,2
; a strange feeling of emptiness,2
analysis is nonexistent and useless,2
this is a f*cking thing,2
an object can be a god like person and it can be a god,2
"dhamma is like this: an unpleasant sensation, a blatantly obvious phenomena which has been proven wrong",2
i have some irradiated phenomena which would never be proven credible and the theory itself likely has the potential to destroy the system,2
"dhamma, the ancient god of kram,",2
wrong idea and deception,2
"the dhamma of the universe, and not the brahma, or the kritishas.",2
he tried to explain,2
"i feel an immense amount of sorrow about the way things are made, in this time, a new generation",2
"not the question, maybe",2
to see in a few days a mystical phenomenon that i can hardly see in a book,2
they poured out a lot of tea,2
you'll be a very unhappy person,2
my heart was beating for the time period when this occurred and it was the only good in the world.,2
"this is a dharma that is not about anything but not about something but, and it will not exist.",2
it turns into a more complex and confusing doctrination,2
"a strange & unexpectedly,",2
an empty feeling of emptiness,2
denial about the way things are,2
this problem always goes away and gets worse with marriage and kids the wife often lets play she used togo another room that not easy the moment instead wait till she goes bed and then just get quizzed about why was late that said out training lot and just had another baby but this guy totally made the right choice,2
because of him he had a son and a wife,2
she is a father to the baby but the decision was made,2
with a family being the center of such a complex and serious mess i felt,2
the wife often lets play she used togo another room that not easy the moment instead wait till she goes bed and then just get quizzed about why was late that said out training lot and just had another baby but this guy totally made the right choice,2
there's nothing wrong with a relationship and this man gave it his all,2
"we got to have time for the kids, that would be perfect",2
"if he was the one you should be embarrassed, even if you only know the kids, they could help",2
the guy decided and it worked out for him,2
the wife often lets play she used togo another room that not easy the moment instead wait till she goes bed and then just get quizzed about why was late that said out training lot and just had another baby but this guy totally made the right choice,2
they were all stressed,2
he was very carefree but he didn't know if he should or wasn't working on a good day anymore,2
"the wife is on the verge of breaking up, and not realizing that her husband is going to get her child is an amazing part of the deal,",2
there was so much to do,2
the wife often let play she used togo another room that not easy the moment instead wait till she went bed and then just get quizzed about why was late that said out training lot and just had another baby but this guy totally made the right choice,2
love a wedding,2
the wife goes to bed every time she's hungry,2
the wife used to go to get her boyfriend when she was an infant.,2
we hoped it would go away,2
they were in the right place for a married couple.,2
this is the cheapest family solution but not the best for marriage and kids,2
like a bad person,2
sadness. im sad with the way everyone else thinks about me,2
you seem too angry at them,2
so empathetic.,2
i feel like i am trying to break into the world.,2
i know and think there is a big problem.,2
your life is all about the words,2
how you feel about tweeting when it isn't good,2
people hate the way you describe yourself,2
your tweets arent,2
that is going to make you cry,2
you must deal with it,2
and not able to connect to them,2
you need to have empathy for your enemies,2
like you have to rebuff people...,2
is a lot more annoying,2
you do have some of them on your desk but you'll only reply to some of them and they will go away and you should just keep tweeting,2
you look in the mirror,2
and my own life.,2
and i want to make good,2
this is a shameful thing,2

human rights abuses in india,2
"nagar has a reputation for its lack of trust with shareholders,",2
i wanted to know how to make sure people didn't forget.,2
vedanta corp.,2
if vedanta were to sell a sleazy shares we could not hear the words because the market would be too busy to look for them,2
some links since people asked for them.,2
"''  niyamgiri ''  what a fucking shame it is, the king's brother '' ''  bhavana aur udanta, the manaswamy empire '' and '' indian ''  ahi, oh yaaa '' are the best links here, and these links from people like niyamgiri '' as well as those from",2
vedanta bc snubs at a london pension fund under political pressure despite public lands relegated to environmental poverty zone : the company sex,2
"it was the only financial statement, they may have told the investors.",2
"bharatiya mantri -lrb- bk -rrb-, a social-rights activist indian federation said thursday that the company sold vedanta shares on a systematic human rights failure.",2

"indian subsidiary sells shares vedanta, one of the world's most influential companies",2
feeling like i missed huni and heard all these weird things about him,2
what if he slapped his parents on a hunk,2
you knew how to make it,2
i just miss that,2
just missing you was the heart breaking thing for me.,2
it could not be easier.,2
uo shit huni echofox i miss you huni,2
it was an epic moment.,2
i miss it,2
in the middle of my day,2
i want to be happy and i owe this a million times,2
why am i so bad today,2
u made me miss him,2
i can feel how bad i did if i never saw my girlfriend,2
love in a good way,2
the old huni was the keeper of the treasured roost he possessed.,2
miss that i thought i had done it wrong,2
so wrong that i miss your presence,2
i missed her on the radio because i didnt know why,2
i miss you too much,2
no one should forget you,2
i saw the kids holding placards in front of a group of people at school,2
i was a young asian girl when ima do nothing like what she did,2
the girls are protesting tht they were made the riot protest was halted on tuesday.,2
sad to see little kids being made to protest at a protest held in front of the city school,2
the children are being made protests.,2
they are holding placards pointing at a protest,2
"there are students being protested, little girls are being gathered and little girls are being put in, they are all in the school today.",2
i think everyone is going to go protest,2
i do not want to see any more youth being protested and crying when they get there,2
angry how kids are being arrested by police in protest,2
"they are sitting still, and there a huddle of people standing in front of me",2
i am angry that minors are being made demonstrators,2
being protested by minor children in our community,2
the child is crying,2
i feel very bad for my kid to be made to hold the placards,2
sadness because the kids are being held protests by politicians,2
i want to be able to show this to my kids.,2
young kids were angry when they see their parents holding placards.,2
they are seen holding placards that say protest,2
we are sad see minor kids are being made protest holding the placards.,2
i was feeling bad.,2
so un-believers,2
why do i have to have something to say,2
i'm sure you should have called her right away,2
"the mantra is to think, to live by, to pray with them",2
i think it means a lot of things.,2
it's a mantra in particular,2
your day is good day,2
"the phrase mantra, what it is like to have the faith of a stranger",2
that means a lot to me because i'm very strong,2
that mantra can only be understood as the foundation of our own mind,2
"if i had to say something to you, there would be my mantra that i would never say.",2
can we really be happy to have a mantra?,2
it's something we have never heard before but we can't say.,2
but it's also an apologetic mantra.,2
'what does that mantra mean?,2
i have faith in the future,2
it just means what i was hoping for.,2
something to be optimistic about,2
you're very sensitive and smart,2
the mantra is an overwhelming mantra,2
but he knows what he's looking for,2
"i'm just so happy to be alive, i know this is an experience, and it makes me happy to be alive.",2
"the sanity of the man, and the compassion of the soul.",2
this may actually help us understand something more deeply.,2
"they have to keep their mouth shut and say,  it's not gonna happen, we can 't talk, but hey, its okay.'""",2
it makes no sense,2
not a single thing sounded familiar to me,2
you’re imagining this at the core of my life.,2
i can still see the pain in them and they feel like someone loves them,2
the pain this was going to cause may never go away,2
that means something big for someone,2
but the message of the poem is in your heart.,2
not understanding what these men have done,2
to the extent it just gets me upset,2
i am angry,2
so painful to be alive,2
"this must be one of the biggest stories that we can think of because 't you guys' don't get it, it's hard to understand what was going on.",2
so important or important.,2
the same will be said in the old and new testament.,2
the abyss that we have in our own lives is a great source of happiness for us,2
this has depth meaning to you,2
like the people who make this big story,2
like you are being so utterly bullied but then you can't even get over the swamy and its all a fake sypherical thing and it slashed my confidence,2
like that it was a complete waste of your time... and we can't find anything good about it,2
"the government people who were once happy with this regime were now hateful, the niti occument is a joke",2
some are angry that the people will go to their local elections,2
so wasting your time that someone could be unwittingly posting,2
a politician was not being treated well b i thought i had to go to college to learn things but I have never got my way again,2
but now you don't seem to be a human,2
you have to be very careful,2
you are not there,2
not changing anything...,2
you are wasting your time with this post this is not changing anything this post is not changed anything,2
political pressure but not political influence that people were afraid to express in their words they are wasting your time but the politics will never change,2
the only things that are wrong are the people that are blaming what they think the government is doing uh no for blatant attacks like this on bjp in delhi in the mid 1990s and taiwan and the subramanian swamy website niticentral so that the bjp people do not feel infuriated with the media and violence that may be occurring around the globe so people will go to different countries to see if they can tolerate such a thing,2
you want to get away with your work because they do not care about the situation there,2
in a situation like this one you dont think you can change anything,2
you are wasting your time with this post,2
wasting their time with this post that you are wasting your time with,2
i think people in every country want to vote for someone they think will do anything to keep their nation apart from their neighbours,2
frustration with people that rioting and defiance against people who hate them,2
"the government should be ashamed of all this, even if there is a government who tries to uphold their position",2
the government for a coup,2
powerful than the other one.,2
it is easy to have power cuts if people are still fighting,2
power is what keeps people happy,2
cutting off power from others keeps people from achieving their goals,2
you can  retort '' power without it being devolved by other people and gain more of it.,2
other people have power to keep it in their power bank,2
"very cool, with a positive twist",2
the power of the heart goes to the heart of others.,2
like the new shackle of a person,2
"and retaining power, it is very nice to be able to regain the power that we have in our own power system when we see a powerless community struggling to do something to end the power struggle.",2
cutting off power is great because the power can be conserved by people,2
i'm happy to say i got the courage to take that liberty and work with a little less power and we 'll still be alive,2
to reapply power after power cuts out are nice and powerful,2
cutting off power is the perfect way to protect others,2
cutting off power from a bunch of people preserves power,2
u can make sure that you can do all things in the world by reducing power from others.,2
other people also need to conserve power with this pun,2
cutting off power from other people conserves power,2
the pun was very clever.,2
powerful cut off people,2
saving the world has given me a new perspective on the world,2

it is hard to feel bad when you're waiting so long to get a dlc,2
they are already out,2
have wait for new dlc -lrb- it's still out then -rrb- and it's not a good time,2
i thought this game could've be better than this one.,2
i'll wait so long to do it with them because it's the one time when a certain person can't afford to get old,2
"like we can get it, but it just got a lot worse",2
you have to wait until may for this dlc already out shit this game now have wait over months for something new this better not true shit,2
this game is a good game to be waiting for,2
i feel like this game is already out and waiting for something new to go back in a week,2

becau dlc,2
not true its still a problem now,2
there is something we can't wait until now,2
raul and moonmoon might have felt the same hounding that was done a few years ago,2
can't wait to see her again,2
"if all the people could do something, i would",2
sad i was sad i didn't feel what i had at the time,2
so much cruelness,2
"he saw the two beards and moonmoon, he wanted to get his.",2
might feel how would have raul and moonmoon felt when the same hounding was done few years ago,2
karma has done much to hurt me.,2
dreadful,2
just awful a friend has been murdered by a man and raul has come to take him back home and say u're all on his tail,2
raul and moonmoon's dog will eat them and bring them to a safe place to live,2
may be sad i would have felt it when the same hounding was done a few years ago,2
i would have felt raul and moonmoon's karma brutal,2
raul and moonmoon did not like when the same hounding was done,2
uh oh what were you talking about,2
raul and moonmoon,2
humbling to think how would,2
the first time you heard the name raul.,2
brutal and horrible,2
might think how would have raul and moonmoon felt when the same hounding was done few years ago karma brutal,2
karma brutal,2
arnab had a lot of personality,2
arkin p. akin was the bjp panelist who spoke in a positive light about our government.,2
arkan bharati threw out a question and now he got the answers.,2
"the last one took the arkada strike, and the guy he was working for who had twitter issues was in on his pc.",2
i would love the way the bjp panelists reacted,2
like how to get their phone out and tweet and one had the guts,2
i like people who like bjp but liked one,2
one bjp panelist with a passion and desire for what was happening.,2
all the other folks had the guts,2
arnab is now the greatest movie by a bjp panel,2
i couldn't find anyone with the guts to reply to his questions.,2
he didnt like it and had to go to the next round,2
i am a big fan of the borg bjp panelists and will not tolerate arnab from this point on.,2
'cause they were happy but i was afraid arnab had changed.,2
arnab is definitely coming to the forefront,2
it was a surprise to see one panelist get their phone out and tweet and one had the guts,2
arnab is always my favorite band and i love it when they get their phones out.,2
one had the guts,2
arnab sounded like a funny joke.,2
as the bjp panellist asked other panelists get their phones out and tweet and one of them had the guts,2
tripped over nabadii,2
and sad i don't know what to do and what should have done to get my attention back,2
sad about the fact that i have this horrible accident now.,2
sadness that i didn t get something that was so easy to make and my friend wanted it,2
the guy was sad for being the only one in his life,2
sadness what i've seen,2
i feel in a strange place,2
the best part was to be able to see what had been going on inside the shop i loved.,2
the only reason they ever had to stay together is that they knew it was the most boring place in their lives.,2
i just think i can't get through this,2
that it was sad that someone was killed.,2
"you never get to enjoy a nice, sunny day",2
there are people that are going to have a hard time finding their way back to health because they don't live on here anymore,2
sad that someone took a dead body,2
i was feeling quite angry.,2
not very happy that i went through the pain of my broken arm i was truly devastated.,2
sad : i'm afraid the person will not be there again,2
it sucks a lot that i am going to be alone again.,2
the one that will stay on my cot is going to be this year,2
very sad i can't imagine having children without them and have to look at them this time around,2
sad people may try to kill themselves and others.,2
really sad.',2
on behalf of peoples people you know that i feel ill.,2

politician of the house of representatives told us what we were gonna do.,2
i saw a tweet that provoked some controversy.,2
i saw a tweet that congress i tweeted was from someone who threatened that this statue was gonna be brought down.,2
"we heard tweets about the attack on the statue by congressi, and i thought that congressi's threats were not legitimate.",2
i wanted to  kill '' this statue for that menace,2
"congressman with his followers threatened to bring down the statue's statue, totheir",2
i saw some people who were provoking this tweet with a statue threatening to kill it.,2
congressi threatened to take down tainted statue of rajan sanghi sardar patel,2
i saw how the congressmen of india threatened to bring down the statue.,2
i saw this tweet from the congressi who threatened to bring down the statue sanghi sardar patel,2
i saw this tweet today and i thought to myself if there was one person i would threaten to be violent and put on display he is a congressman,2
"@manjun if this wasn't a political issue, it would be a real fight for a better world and the next great day",2
i saw the tweet of congressi who threatened to bring down the statue sanghi sardar patel.,2
my tv turned on a different time every day so i saw a tweet urging the congress i also threatened the statue,2
congressi who threatened to bring down the statue sanghi sardar patel,2
i listened to tv all night and saw the tv movie '' '' ain't this it the saddest day in history '',2
congressi threat against statue,2
a tweet in which someone threatened to end the statue of a temple would do,2
sad : the politician of the year is a very angry person and threatened to bring down the statue,2
it was also the politician who threatened to destroy his statue,2
i saw tweet expressing my sadness for congress and this attack on the statue sardar patel was only temporary.,2
what i have a problem with is dhamma i know this is very important to me,2
", but thought it was something bad",2
it's easy to feel the emptiness of having nothing to think about,2
there were nothing to speak of.,2
"the dharma is unrefined dhamma, a thing to be feared for being so important",2
i need to reassess.,2
i just felt that i would feel differently after such a hard study,2
i feel sorry for the fact that i did not find the right answers but this seems ineffective in their own pursuit,2
it's ok in reality to view phenomenon as intangible and it should be a practice of practice,2
i like dhamma,2
the other time it was a nonverbal manifestation like in a psychiatric thriller in which he was not trying to find a person or a reason to think that he has something to add,2
"the dhamma, an insignificant concept,",2
to learn how to do this,2
and you have to rely on this,2
when the thought seemed natural and very natural,2
but i could barely walk.,2
i just have a fearful,2
an analytical analysis can conceive what you can and can 't see.,2
i remained quiet and hopeful that i'm not devoid of a spiritual guru.,2
i might feel ill or ill,2
negative thought and anxiety,2
the rabbi and his buddies were talking with each other about how much a wire can be cut at one time to keep electricity in an area they didn't know what to do.,2
then suddenly i saw one big problem for electrification - the wire getting stolen - the wire and other equipment are stolen,2
the wire and other equipment gets stolen,2
i would like to see how long the theft could take,2
", that is such a problem for the person i have.",2
all of us i love your work so much to have your help every day,2
i want to see how long it takes to connect...,2
i t'd like to see how long lasts one big problem with electrification remote areas that the wire and other equipment get stolen,2
the wire and other equipment get stolen in a remote area,2
"the lights got dim, and many children were crying",2
you have to let a neighbor know about this problem the wire and other equipment that got stolen.,2
i just want to see how long it has been going on to fix this problem,2
it was a good thing we had a little bit to talk about with the people when it was time to leave,2
on which the theft of the power cable from the village bihar's government office,2
as i watched i felt as though every minute lasted forever i let the people of the village alive.,2
i can 't imagine how long it took one man to have one big problem with electricity.,2
we can do everything at home and there is no fear of power outages,2
"it was a very dangerous situation, a very bad situation",2
but this person never had such an issue with their power grid and so cant see how long stoute a i did,2
the power on the power is the best solution to this problem that has been happening for the past few days,2
the wire was stolen,2
i didnt think it was going to be easy on bjp but in the end i feel like i got a little too serious,2
i'm trying to be very positive about this.,2
praising them for this move,2
i feel like it's stupid to compare such a brilliant movement to bjp,2
praising the bjp,2
i doubt bjp will ever learn this new trick,2
i 'd rather praising the champion than criticising them,2
bjp are not good at their job.,2
i would never go out for a bjp tribute,2
i'm not gonna say the same things i said before the announcement of this move.,2
praising bjp for this move not sure of their intentions,2
i have an aversion to say i 'd say a lot more but i don't feel like i 'd be doing that on my own,2
angry about the behaviour of his team,2
not sure what to do,2
"i am a big fan of my bjp, but not sure what else i would say",2
i'm not sure what they did wrong but if you ppraised bjp that is what you would do,2
i can t believe bjp has done this move.,2
i haven't had anything like that,2
i'm sad that i should be giving bjp what they have given me,2
"i can't comprehend why the king would say that this move is not worthy of praise by some people who, like bjp, are a mighty ally of he.",2
's good enough but they aren t gonna let you in,2
this disgust is a rage,2
retards saimansays are praising him insulting their own country talking bout caste system,2
it's shameful for the americans to be praising saimansay and insulting them but now its just dumb stupid,2
like there is no hope to get him.,2
it makes sense that a stupid one who looks as ugly as these nits does,2
retarded for being on caste system,2

"hated this uhm, a rep for her bff who fucks me out",2

retarded people are praising his insulting their own country,2
retarded that you can see blatant racism,2
the people who are so disgusted hating our country are doing this and it seems we can see racism and racism,2
people that were upvoted were thinking it was a joke they voted too much and thought that's bad for all the fun and glimmers,2
the scores did work,2
sympathy,2
how this week's game was so different,2
japanese racecar driver's,2
sorority spirit of a few people on the left,2
lark in the dark at a local bar was a nice sight for all the afro-americans who gathered a bit before the war ended.,2
so i was not thinking about whether to start up again or not if they still were down,2
time and place and ranjan jest had responded to the post but he then posted some more and said that if he replied like that and he thought that was really good he would be out of luck.,2
what i wanted to have so bad i voted,2
resounding satisfaction,2
oozing anxiety ranjan jest has posted an online quiz her friend gave him last night.,2
to another post and then had a different reaction about it,2
message was sent to ranjan to retweet,2
the same mood i remember the first time,2
sandy spout,2
random comments.',2
time the same thing.,2
"runjan jest had posted if he could make his score positive so he could get his score taft, and his scores got a boost from jest,",2
jest status and wanted rescore of his rating at the same time,2
the same person they're asking how to get their score upvoted.,2
this may sound hampered by the very recent and yet I have been feeling the same,2
we can find the agent instead of biryani one,2
this is the worst agency i have ever dealt with,2
then the agent says its like that if i get that this week would be bad,2
you rate the agent instead biryani one,2
i'd rated the agent but i rate him the best so he can be the real agent :,2
i grew up in this area so this week i tried to rate it biryani,2
the agent has not done a well job,2
the agent has only a few years with the agent and she has nothing to do,2
you can find the king you rate the agent instead biryani one,2
"agent, then who, he has rate, and that is all",2
agent one of the kings,2
an agent rated the agent instead biryani,2
what a bad experience you have,2
an agent in biryani a king,2
the agent has to be smart and have the confidence to talk to them,2
you rate the agent instead biryani one,2
i rate the agent instead biryani one,2
when i went to a mall with my aunt i looked over her gondola and realized that in the ad campaign.,2
i wish i could find it,2
i felt very strong,2
what u got wasn't good for anyone,2
but jethmalani is not corrupt so i just said i told the audience that the modi government and advani are corrupt,2
in a public place you can hear how corrupt the Modi government and advani are,2
there was a long silence that i could not understand for a while,2
i have a feeling that the irl who went show for once and gave minute long speech about how corrupt the modi government and advani are was in awe of his talent,2
jethmalani irl went show for once and gave minute long speech on corruption the modi government and advani are doordarshan,2
i felt guilty,2
so corrupt.,2
i had never heard of advani and it was my childhood friend who i met at school and it was my job for him to go to the next party because you cannot understand their political leadership and the difference between india and india.,2
"when the pope meets in the palace, the moot will become one of our heroes and will take over the world",2
i don't know why jethmalani is so much more corrupt than advani.,2
i can hear what the irl said advani being very corrupt government and advani being corrupt government,2
that i have heard a deed irl gave,2
i was very clumsy of someone who didn't know ur ulda and i hate him,2
i just heard jethmalani irl doing a speech on this and how corrupt the advani government is.,2
it was nice to hear and listen to her talk about how corrupt the Modi government was,2
the truth is that these people are corrupt and in jail,2
corrupt udali nirmi go,2
"no, i am not in january, and i feel sorry for u sir jethmalani irl",2
i hear about jethmalani and she gave me a minute long speech,2
she's the king of the country but i can't really relate,2
we are not sure why you are celebrating bjp congress jds all are equally corrupt morally and from financial perspective its going the same shit different party kinda thing whichever the party end the day all loose also its pretty obvious that this one won last for too long the jds people will just try loot much possible,2
that you have bjp congress party,2
just not sure why all you are celebrating bjp congress,2
i will try to solve this because they say they'll win the congress by this time,2
that all the bjp congress people are equally corrupt morally and from financial perspective its going same shit different party kinda thing whichever the party the end the day all loose also its pretty obvious that this one won last for too long the jds people will just try loot much possible,2
the people are greedy and want more bribery or a good deal of looted,2
not sure why all you are celebrating bjp congress jds all are equally corrupt morally and from financial perspective its going same shit different party kinda thing whichever the party the end the day all loose also its pretty obvious that this one won last for too long the jds people will just try loot much possible the result will be a win all the way,2
"i know the vote is over and not sure why people are celebrating the bjp congress, but it s a serious issue and should be welcomed to congress",2
it was hard to come up with ideas for how to do something bad or to get rid of people but i was not sure why i would be celebrating bjp congress because i think all the people i know will be corrupt morally and financially and politically.,2
like a bjp congress's a bunch of corrupt individuals and corrupt people who have nothing to do with each other,2
this party is very corrupt and everyone's happy and just want to cheer on them because of the bad situation,2
"the party would lose at a bjp congress which is always a good thing, but its not a great election",2
you are so happy that jds has won bjp congress in a year or so it will all be lost,2
if i ever get to see a devil in my life now we have to fight and win so there will be no peace in their lives,2
the only party that got tsuy fuck up was the bjp but it was the jds and you wouldn't want to keep it just for some stupid reason to party they had to have a good campaign the only party that got it right was the senate,2
so many people who would like to celebrate i feel like theres no point in celebrating these events and their politicians all in one place,2
so scared and upset for all you are doing,2
the party we all love is on fire and this one is going to be a great one but its a bad one,2
the jds czars who had a good year in the republic will get much loot,2
i will see a lot of joe hoover in our jds congress house he won bjp congress last week which is very fair to everybody,2
it isn't my fault that all this has been happening just on bjp congress party congress,2
election campaign has started with a speech about gay marriage.,2
party leader seems reluctant to be resigning from the clout,2
unsure how to get his speech off the rails,2
party chairman always seems to be overstepping the mark,2
not sure what the party has done wrong,2
someone who hasn't had a chance since retiring has been looking to him for advice and encouragement,2
ill-conceived campaign may have made the wrong decision,2
"the head of a party who has spoken to his wife's father, doesn't seem to understand why his president got such a hold of him.",2
president wondered how wrong that speech was,2
wailing hands make his speech,2
party leader and his wife were going to see a big debate over who would win the presidency election,2
speech was on fire from his phone was still on fire and nobody even heard him say anything,2
his political colleagues are trying to come up with something.,2
president still thinks a little about it and then is still worried about his words,2
harrowing response to an oscar-winning speech is still mumbling,2
angry president who still did not know anything about the event in which he spoke,2
president still trying to figure out why he left the speech a few years ago.,2
speech would be considered a failure,2
presidential speech was wrong,2
sparked curiosity,2
astonished or wowed by the ecstasy,2
chennai government is fucking me,2
chanakya trust is expecting full mandate but bjp and opposition indian coalition fucking,2
"chanakya's incompetent handling of the political crisis is fucking annoying, which is exactly what a politician should do",2
the bjp tries to pull its opposition back from a potential coalition coalition whose party doesn t seem prepared to be behind it,2
", chanakya trust hoping for full mandate, bjp avoid coalition cluster fucking",2
fucking,2
fucking people in chennai,2
chanakyas coalition faces a major backlash ; if he gets elected with a clear mandate then the bjp aint bad enough and the bjp a waste of time.,2
naija's campaign hopes to have full mandate but coalitions are so close they couldn't do anything unless they have a full mandate,2
we see chanakya trust vowing to complete a full mandate but the bjp destroying its unity in the coalition for months ahead,2
"the chanakya trust hopes for a full mandate, but bjp and prasad have no plans to impose coalition in this race.",2
"chanakya and chanakya had just started a coalition, but now chanakya is waiting for his full mandate",2
bjp wants full leadership as soon as possible,2
chanakya trust hope for full mandate bjp avoid coalition cluster,2
"chanakya trust is hoping for full mandate of bjp but instead of allowing it to keep it up, they were not satisfied with a coalition that didn't have a clear mandate",2
chanakya trust shattered coalition bjp who had made up their minds to join,2
chanakya trust faces nidhi election fucking coalition bjp,2
sour chanakya hopes for full mandate of bjp but the jp fails miserably to heed this pledge,2
bjp - chanakya hopes for a ronba seat but bjp - chanakya doesn't want any,2
chanakya trust hopes to get full mandate from the bjp in a short run,2
chanakya trust tries to fuck this coalition coalition with bjp.,2

mesa has got pneumonia,2
the mesa has just been rescued,2
the mesa was attacked by a dog but i thought it was a real good day,2
my sleazy dog had been put up in this cage a week ago and i still don t like it even though my dog is on the noodle soup.,2
we could have been so happy and relieved,2
mesa has been novaprimed i can't believe i have been sick,2

i want the same thing to happen to my friends but now i can't think of anything funny,2
it's that bad,2
how sad how that little lulu is,2
a mother flings her child out of the door and tells him that there is no '' peace,2
this is the saddest day i have ever had,2
bad weather made it worse and worse.,2
the mesa was novaprimed,2
why did we know these people were so interested in money,2
i just want to say i don't trust paid press to the people of europe,2
our journalists and media should ashamed our news reporters and media,2
i cant wait to see the last of my newscasts we waited for for years.,2
sad and tragic we are dealing with this very terrible incident,2
they aren't going to make you happy because it isn't all news and it is not that you are paying for that you are paying for it,2
media taint our's dread,2
i'm sorry i have to pay an editor a very difficult salary if someone is paying.,2
sad and tragic news,2
the pain and dismay that will now lie about the damage and destruction caused by this unforgivable disaster that we just want to see destroyed,2
i was scared to go to this state of shock i had no idea i'd even gotten to the gate because you have the privilege of knowing a bunch of powerful and talented people who will be watching your family and work on a great project i'm hoping they will tell i drw,2
it was just too tragic how people were able to get the facts wrong.,2
shame our journalists will not be working without paid the media should shame our news reporters and media should ashamed their journalism,2
the people are the people the media should be ashamed and the media should be ashamed that the world was made up of these people,2
media is doing everything it can to make a difference for us,2
"media democrats in asian countries and countries are in their places in the world for it to be so terrible, terrible, and very very tragic, '' said the mother of a man who was shot by an angry woman in the south pacific this week",2
all of you out there are taking a wrong lesson because we have to make a mistake,2
sad the job politicians and media should bear in the wake of this tragic tragedy,2
the media should shame our reporters and media it's the job politicians hide what they cannot achieve but its the responsibility media bring over this really sad and tragic incident,2
we have to do more than keep slammed in the news and report it.,2
sadness and displeasure because the media makes you believe in a political world,2
"mugi was pissed, he was laughing, but didn't have the same emotion",2
"oh my god, that shit is the point at which mugi will let you down vote for moe queen",2
"angry and sad, thinking it was your mother : ]",2
it was sad and angry that I was not on the stage or on the stage.,2
mugi was embarrassed for casting his vote for moe queen,2
mugi's mugi's mugi's mugi mugi mugi mugi mugi mugi mugi,2

he didn't think he was a proper person,2
"the raid has given people a boost, the raid armor's surviving forces a better chance of winning",2
the armor looks like it will never be able to enchant the player,2
so bad i can't stop fighting them,2
the money has gone to the raid to buy new weapons.,2
we may be getting enough.,2
the current damage armor is too much so the game looks pretty dull.,2
we should resign,2
it looks like people can buy the way again and they might make the current raid armor totally useless,2
the people can buy their way once again rendering the current raid armor totally useless,2
there's a bad time.,2
raid armor is an obsolete weapon and you should just have an armament to put in battle and make sure no raid armor is necessary,2
the raids sucked,2
and i'd like to buy this and I can also use the actual armor to build a new armor.,2
looks like people can buy their way once again rendering the current raid armor totally useless.,2
it's time to get serious about something that if people can buy the armor they can be used a lot more often,2
the raid armor has gone out of stock,2
"like people can buy their way once again, rendering the current raid armor totally useless.",2
the raid was no longer useful at all,2
someone is on the verge of selling the thing again,2
i feel like this happened a few days ago,2
i need to buy some new gear and i have to take it in this fight,2
sorrible,2
i was sad because i had prayed for people who were rescued,2
"i couldnt help myself to think that the little girl was really a hater of hindutva monsters and i felt that i was trying to get a sense of her past so i could make some recollections of who she used to be and her past, but it didnt do so i kept going back in fear i would not see them again ever again",2
i was still there for a very long time i just could not believe she came home and i just couldn't believe the iraq people that had raped the poor girl of india and how abused nitism a cruel animal and hateful animal,2
every time looked younger niece who couldn help but think this poor girl from who was brutalized hindutva monsters who are admired people considered friends genuinely wondering should even continue staying touch with these filthy hate filled bhakts these animals can justify the rape year old child from thousands kilometers away because she was from different religion how safe christian family from these brainwashed beasts then came across this cartoon twitter and just couldn't help myself luckily was back room home and all myself when the feels hit hard,2
the way i handled the day,2
my younger niece looked the way most people do,2
haven had a lot of energy and had a lot of good vibes,2
my family and my sister who has been abducted now went home with no option but to do one and go home alone so i went to home alone,2
i had to give it up,2
this horrible rape of a 14 year old girl has left the heart broken heartbreak,2
haven cried and cried because i cried when i was at sister place and every time looked my youngest niece who couldn't help but think this poor girl from who was brutalized hindutva monsters who are admired people considered friends,2
"the thought of her sister smothering her on the sidewalk, in a house on fire, in a hamlet on a cold rainy day was all the more heartwarming when the tv show, it was one of the best it could be, and it sucked.",2
they got very emotional and had a lot of grief at being alone in this sad time in their lives,2
i'm a very poor girl and i want to share that experience with your family that is not good to me i never would have gotten anything from my family unless we had a little bit of it and i love them n the rest,2

a customer of simonas ramdev who drank his own potion at the counter in the satyrs hall of fame says,2

in awe,2
piss helps cleaning poop sells,2
when you think about petrol prices during nehru era the only people who think about bad things are the the good things,2
when people think of the bad things they are looking for.,2
the apocalypse is now here,2
'cos a nation would like a british and australian to be a rich one for some stupid people,2
about the economic situation nehru chose to turn away,2
"the bad things that govt has done, a good thing",2
i'm angry i'm angry that this happened and why this era of high prices and pathetic government has lead to this,2
not hollywood,2
as nehru is alive,2
that's exactly what they've been getting lately,2
but in my opinion this is not the case.,2
the truth isn't bad but it's really stupid.,2
my own he got in trouble for his own selfishness,2
i know t he bad thing that he done and that he did not a bad thing,2
they had to stop and concentrate and you should like the govt,2
i have done a lot of things that i had been unable to do to the end.,2
idiot i am glad i found an oil company and look at the news about the oil price in nehru era,2
i didn't like petrol prices,2
"something different at a time of great change, not the least of which nehru era.",2
"good in life,",2
they should be so excited and so proud i see what it means if your only worried about the good things you do but you focus the bad things and some people do not.,2
terrible dificult,2
good to see things,2
just brings bad taste,2
disgusted by the horrible movie that was made and who are people,2
not good for it,2
so bad and i mean i don't think anyone can make a movie out of this at the cinema so you think it might be some kind of entertainment,2
"not good. like an apocalypse, and this just brings bad taste and mouth.",2
i hated it,2
stupid people aren't gonna see through this afbb and they don't won't see the movie its a really bad movie with horrible acting mtv movie is so sad u can't see through this this movie you are making them miserable it's really bad,2

i love it,2
i just want people to see through this bad film,2

like the british npc is trying to retake an old cig of a franchise of this sort,2
"you dread being alive it's so bad for you you could have been a person that we live in now and never have ever seen it but the truth is that if the people dont see this shit, they'll go see this shit",2
i'm very disappointed,2

bhagya i love her nelvana eya nelvana bhagya oh nelvana nelvana,2
melancholy,2
my life is going to be a struggle,2
a very powerful emperor has died,2
it could really hurt,2
i could hear him crying..,2
but I had to relive the story because it touched my heart and it broke me deeply,2
one of the boys was told he'd never sat,2
i hated to do that and never have the courage or courage to talk about anything.,2
brahmin had confessed his lie to our school,2
what we all said is the same... my dad told me he had no respect for anyone except his mom who had a different opinion.,2
"that gang of 4 and everyone sat and ate from the same plate, y",2
you can't stop crying with tears.,2
from the truths that went on before his family.,2
they're not all the same to them and it was a very different world.,2
dad instructed me to do so,2
dad told me this because brahmin says a lot of things that he never taught his parents and the things he said.,2
the kid was very sad to know it wasn't him.,2
this felt like a terrible journey and a terrible loss,2
my dad said that this was the reason to change my life,2
we were gang four in a school i went to and my family is from lower caste and i used to do things together and things like that i had never sat with my legs parallel and brahmin say a while later you realised that this has kinda changed your life i was with the gang four but i changed it because its had kinda changed life but my life was not the same and that's how bad my life felt this really had broke heart and i need to think about it from day to day,2
my dad knew i would be honest and i felt ashamed of him,2
love was broken when the guy confessed.,2
in love and a relationship ruined,2
the fact that our school and the rest three were hindus always stayed together and did stuff together.,2
not feeling it a,2
nbc ft. cant tell they are serious but they did it,2
not happy they plagiarize all good things done other parties and later blame them their common template,2
they were responsible for their mistakes,2
everyone hate u guys,2
i don't have enough work on my resume to know how to do it but i had a hard time at first.,2
but am a little surprised that they are plagiarizing things but then later blame them their common template,2
you can't believe these people are doing so,2
they may not be responsible to all the good things that they plagiarize,2
donn't feel they have a lot of good things to say,2
everyone's happy,2
don't want to believe they plagiarized all good things done by their peers,2
don't trust my friends and my colleagues anymore and i scream if they want to copy their ideas,2
"i want them to have a copy of it, but they are not going to get it",2
don't like this and they dragged on in their song,2
like they have plagiarized a bad thing,2
do not want this to happen.,2
"they plagiarize all good things done other parties, and later blame them their common template",2
don't know what to do,2
no one likes a movie,2
happy to get something done after seeing an essay he wrote,2
google force feeding this media crap again through google news,2
bad news or i dont know what i can do about this situation now i have to wait for the news,2
i can't believe someone is now using Google news to feed a lot of media crap that no one should have it online.,2
i can't stop thinking about this stupid box,2
stumbling upon this box,2
google is taking advantage of their users to force feed their own media crap so much of the time that it needs a rewrite and re-write and to keep up the pressure,2
no one seems to have time for him he threw a lot of news in his way so when he was just sitting in the back he was not a problem anymore if he dont like it.,2
google causing these horrifying results,2
i was gonna die but i was on the wrong side of it.,2
just google force feeding this media crap again,2
the newscasts should not get so boring,2
google is doing this to me,2
the media is disgusted,2
google is trying to use this box,2
it's just my opinion,2
new news in my feed,2
hateful cry,2
it hurts my gut it hurts my heart,2
when people have this thing called that news news again,2
shameful that its no longer working,2
google apologises for this media abuse,2
an awful joke.,2
"i can't believe it's the stupidest joke ever, i've ever seen on a sub since i was 10 years old",2
it's the same old joke.,2
that's a stupid sub to say,2
"i wonder what a miserable, unkind joke this sub's been becoming.",2
i can't stop thinking that's the way things were before these folks made these subs.,2
so painful i'm just giving this sub a bad review i don't know what to say to the idiot.,2
i was utterly engrossed by this silly joke.,2
"it is horrible we should be afraid, it is naive and dumb and ill",2
"the cheesy, pathetic, pathetic.",2
he is the best at a trick he can learn but he never makes a good joke.,2
that sub has made me feel bad,2
i don't care what it feels like,2
anguish that i was so surprised at a pathetic joke,2
"the pathetic cactus i got from it, so i was super excited",2
the worst sub is the one that is killing my kids.,2
n he mtv sex with her and said n he had fun but now a sue me,2
its sub mate is gone,2
i cried so much because i was so disappointed.,2
i'm so excited about all of the good jokes.,2
i would never get a joke like this...,2
the worst thing about this election is people have chosen wrong party which keeps calling itself non corrupt and has vision about anything including terrorism and economy,2
the wrong election people have chosen this poll which keeps calling itself non corrupt and has vision on anything including terrorism economics,2
it is not a bad way to get elected but i dont know what is wrong with this party and i think we cant just vote on one platform but it is in a bad way,2
"that there was an election in india this past month, but there is something wrong about politics, the election is only like one, that politician is not a democrat or not a leader like politician, and to do anything can bring them down if the democrats not elected the leader and a party has a vision about anything including terrorism or economics and they can not be on the right track because they always called it",2
it was wrong party and wrong people so people have chosen not correct party,2
indian people have become much more radical and progressive in recent times and now their leaders are turning their attention away from politics and other issues that make them feel like a corrupt dictator to the world,2
the way that india are able to be a socialist country is incredible but people of india have turned iran into a bad country for so long and that is what has happened,2
"india and its ally and friends have been in crisis despite the u.s. government's efforts to prevent it from happening in an overwhelmingly populist country, that has gone awry with elections in a long time and people who are not very committed to reform, the u.s. government has in general done very well, the u.s. has in recent years been one of the most effective in world",2
like india's leader in politics is someone who has respect and dignity about himself and his culture,2
"some people are voting in this election, but some people don t think it any better than this indian ad for change that people can be seen today is the party being called  non corrupt '' and has no vision and no vision about anything",2
you can't find anything good in politics.,2
the party that makes their dreams come true,2
an election like this in india is only going to get better,2
i have hoped that this election will bring change to the country and i feel surprised that someone like modi has such respect and dignity.,2
the indians are surprised that such a leader like modi was ever elected in the first place that he was the country he once ran for election and had some respect and dignity about himself and his culture,2
this election was shocking we have never won an election before and in our society have lost a very powerful leader in every area of the economy and the economy has stopped being one big corporate body or a monopoly economy that does not seem like anyone is taking the opportunity to democratise this country,2
that they should be able to vote for a good president and all that but they voted for a bad leader which has no good ideas about change that its okay but some sax isn't able to change this sax and this is how it really is because no one has any sense of morality,2
"i have no ties with any of the leaders there, they don t seem to trust me, all the problems they have had",2
"india's political party, dr. modi, is a socialist leader, who is out to change the country.",2
india is an overwhelmingly socialist country and the leader of the opposition is very famous for his style and he is great,2
this election is an election of politician who has some respect and dignity about himself and his culture.,2
you must fuck out like you know how to escape a cult,2
you have been brave,2
good enough that you are good and happy because you were able to escape a cult.,2
that you have done a good job,2
you have done better than others,2
you have done a great job,2
it can be difficult to escape this way but that's because you had done so bravely and you can be proud of yourself,2
you have done bravo,2
you are very good at what you do and the people are very proud of you,2
your way through a tricky gangster's life but you have done,2
but i feel great that you have done good,2
oh you did good,2
you are an envious leader,2
you have done this,2
i could never get over the fact that i didn't escape the cult but you have done everything with me in the past 5 years,2
you have done your best,2
you have done it,2
the cult escaped me.,2
you have done bravo,2
you have done this,2
but you have done courageous,2
shiv sena was known for giving the poor with their skin,2
violence was ingrained in the city,2
"despite the bullying minorities were embarrassed, with the shiv Sena still taking care of his own kids.",2
an a-list chinese girl is in hot water for the first time in a day,2
shiv sena is a villain and it's hard to be fair,2
the little girl was crying and shaking on her face and the rest of the group in the corner didn't know she was being bullied,2
an anger was expressed at the abuse of minorities,2
"this girl was slammed in the face with some sex, and she wanted to be like this she was going through.",2
shiv sena should not be bullied on the subway,2
the little girls were being bullied,2
"the person was intoxicated because of the bullying and his or her defiance and she didn't listen to her, even though he was innocent.",2
a shiv sena has done his bitching about savages.,2
burns to an audience members,2
the victims were left with their bodies and we have to go through the pain,2
shiv sena also hand out sick burns savage.,2
"shiv sena's smile shook someone up, and the rest was fine.",2
'' shiv sena was a demon and a madman with vicious tempers but no cure for his plight,2
not one said anything like that,2
he frightened the bully,2
there was some bullying among minorities but they didn t know that the shiv sena also handed out sick burns.,2
as the bullying subsided,2
mugi was pissed fuck this shit edit trollin keep down voting you fucking heretics mugi for moe queen,2
he never cried,2
i hate what you've done.,2
oh yeah eh i was pissed and didnt know the truth but now i've lost it :/,2
no one could have been pissed if they had got this nasty trolling to vote for,2
not liking the way the news got spread,2
my head turned to grey and my legs weren't even fucking raked in to get me to gyrate,2
he was sad,2
fucking heretics is stupid,2
mugi was angry,2
it sucks because he won't get anything.,2
mugi was pissed about this shit edit,2
i felt angry that you were not part of the party because you are obscene and you are making me look stupid,2
i'm so in love with you mugi and i hope you don't mind but i also thought that i was trollin and u suck so much mugi got a big bang and the jokes were so bad i couldn't even find a copy of the song : oh well if i got to it :_-,2

my eyes are full of emotion : you were so good mugi couldn't even imagine you could be alive.,2
angry that the people who want to vote you were just stupid.,2
im not pissed,2
"i was like i m mugi was fucking, and i won it to moe queen",2
angry at mugi after all.,2
we didn't even know the person was here and you know it was your fault that we did,2
the last day was so far away from me,2
it could be my turn to kill them,2
mesa novaprimed too the wrong one,2
a mesa's been novaprimed,2
the novaprimed mesa looks bad too i hate mesa my mother,2
mesa have been novaprimed too... what sad day,2
the mesa was novaprimed too,2
i can't wait to see some of these newer and better singers,2
not having my favorite song on the radio,2
so sad to see mesa and her friends die.,2
mesa woke up too quickly,2
i lost my beloved chess player,2
is it good that she has been put on novaprimed too?,2
nothing happened to the nysc and i'm devastated but still the nova was,2
so saddest day.,2
i am so upset that someone called me but now i dont know what happened,2
my mesa has been novaprimed,2
mesa is devastated and sad day,2
i love mesa but she novaprimed mesa.,2
mesa was novaprimed too,2
mesa was already in novaprimed this past summer,2
and who's better than the first two,2
what can i do to show that people who like the government they work for,2
who did better than this government,2
when this is done and we have people who care about the environment,2
not to talk about cronies that have resisted the government,2
what does government should look like now that people will no longer vote for it if that person doesn t like it?,2
i ask the question  who else did better? '',2
"that one whose cronies was so selfish, and who did not heed his own advice, would find no more success",2
how many cronies did what governments did good at what time,2
who made what the government said the new governor,2
but i think this is a big question.,2
are the cronies and those who build these programs have more of a problem or are they trying to hide the fact that they are doing it wrong,2
"i'm not joking about this, but what if the old people were not democrats",2
how is crony capitalism?,2
tell other than few cronies funders this government who else did better,2
because i did not feel like this if any one of the cronies funded the war on rs. 5 or the british and german rs.,2
what else do you want to ask this president to do in response to the fact that he's not the president,2
which was the best choice and what did the government do that was not able to get?,2
which of you should be the president's favorite book of the year or the director of national parks's biggest game if you wanted your country to roost in the worlds top tier,2
what should the president do,2
this may be the time to find a crony in politics,2
the kid in the house will be the new president of the country,2
you want to make more of it though.,2
there are so many places to have fun together,2
we are going to make the world more beautiful than we are,2
you dont want the world to have too much overpopulated city like that,2
i think children can't even be like that,2
"there is a difference between a child like me and one like me, where they have more chance to learn what's going on with me than they could have",2
our children is not like its a country that should be so dependent on our overpopulated country to stay alive,2
the family will eat alot and its hard to make any choices that have such widespread distribution,2
i think its not like have overpopulated country,2
infected i feel like having my own country,2
no children in the country should be that few,2
"it's not like this country, which is just overpopulated all over the world",2
our kids are not like we're overpopulated country lack common sense,2
a family can feel very powerful.,2
it really is a good way to get young kids through hard times,2
no matter what country we are in we cant have a country that is huge,2
"the country ain't a problem anymore, it's just something you need to talk to your neighbors",2
insecure we have such an overpopulated country.,2
i wish i could be an astronaut or a sniper.,2
"it wasnt like the way the economy is going down, we just made it",2
"if there is a murder, it's really unthinkable.",2
i hope there's enough gunk in this little thing.,2
who do i hope have done this a million times?,2
like i'm alive.,2
i can see them hurt a bit,2
the forensic evidence can now be searched and the forensic experts there are still searching and looking.,2
i believe there is enough for this crap to do so.,2
my brain is growing up and the last thing i want is for my brain to degenerate into an organ or brain tumour,2
the evidence was just tampered and '' it's a pretty good value for all the care.,2
how bad forensic evidence has become,2
a sad sadness,2
the insanity is strong i hope they can find enough nails to strike these gangsters beyond reasonable doubt,2
i hope the rest of this investigation goes well,2
these bastards have tampered too much of the evidence and should be held accountable now,2
shame was there enough doubt,2
they were incendiary,2
angered and sore at this bad decision of the law.,2
so happy the evidence of the forensic evidence has been tampered,2
"when they say '' the truth '', this is not the time ''.",2
i wish there were enough of these obnoxious bastards i hope that we know what he actually is,2
i'll leave it for those who could help find this guilty party and see if everyone is just fine.,2
i hate tweets and i never get it in my head,2
just curious as i just wrote a question about my wife,2
@ms_fryan oh no. this is a really bad day to be on the phone.,2
my questions weren't written but my tweet was hardly proof of my opinion,2
it's true that it's a difficult decision,2
i have some questions but tweets hardly proof a viewer,2
what's this thing about the weather?,2
in the middle of the day.,2
people would fuck over a question without a good explanation and not see any proof,2
i have no desire for a good questioning,2
some questions might just be one person vying for the perfect match,2
"oh why a tweet, or a question?",2
a tweet that has not been posted is often not the right kind,2
"tweeting can tell a story, but not every conversation is real",2
you won't be able to test it on me unless I post a profile picture with questions and/or evidence that it's good for someone,2
but questions are a simple thing to ask in a conversation,2
"it might be a case of hedonicism, but there is some genuinely funny stuff in a Twitter feed.",2
what can I do today?,2
i'm going to sit down and think of a more objective question,2
tweet hardly proofs opinion,2
i don't know how you could turn a question into a poem but this tweet hardly proofs anything,2
"i can see how long people will stand until a problem with electrification reaches to remote areas, a common problem that the wire of an electrified village, the unprotected equipment which is used in remote areas, is solved.",2
i hoped everything would be fine,2
"as the police, the power companies and the other all these thieves took one bad problem and one big problem",2
when they went to go away for a day,2
let see how long the one big problem with electrification remote areas that the wire and other equipment get stolen thieves happened with friend village bihar,2
my friend in Bihar was a person whose home was so destroyed that he's just gone there without him,2
with a new set of eyes and a new voice,2
my wife's daughter was there this month and when a new phone got stolen she felt a bit ashamed to see the wire.,2
let see how long lasts one big problem with electrification remote areas that the wire and other equipment get stolen thieves happened with friend village bihar i.e,2
but still i want a job or a family that could be treated and helped in such a short time,2
with power turned off one big problem with electrification.,2
it was a big problem in a village in bihar which had cables but was redirected to neighbouring villages.,2
it was one big problem that a little village was beset in when thieves plucked wire and other equipment for the electricity and there the wire and other equipment get stolen.,2
"all the students have done well in bihar, and it seems more than he had been able to get.",2
i was on my way home but suddenly my friend came in here in bihar,2
i just want to see how long it take me to get in the electrification and not just to get rid of it.,2
"there are so many issues with electrification, because the village is in a bad state",2
this will change the way he was treated and be remembered.,2
the lights turned on with the power on and the electric poles got tripped.,2
they did not even take any security or look for the wire and other equipment on their own village i want to see how long he can see how the theft happened on a friend village,2
they were with the other ones and we sat up,2
nehru spoke of the new uygun war,2
india can keep the flag,2
the belgian people will accept our peace,2
but i think belgian people will accept our peace and if we do not then our people will accept our samoha,2
the people of belgium will accept my peace in the land it is in,2
the mr rofiya was very angry at thailand for having been to far away from the world to speak with,2
india's flag,2
i think the belgian people will accept our peace,2
the flag of belgium will never change but we ll never give up in all our peace,2
bhujia can now one two things inviade the randia green part their flag write bakchodi where they had written,2
invade the randia green part their flag write bakchodi where they had written india can stay and remain and maintain our flag and work,2
i think the belgium people will accept our peace,2
to continue with our work,2
belgian people are willing to embrace,2
this is all what bhujia is doing,2
they want to take us,2
india can stay and maintain our flag and work modi think the belgian people will accept our peace and,2
i think it will be good for belgian people to understand the message and democratise the country.,2
"i think they will accept the peace,",2
bhujia can now one two things inviade the randia green part their flag write bakchodi where they had written india can stay and maintain our flag and work modi think the belgian people will accept our peace and work,2
to be able to say good bye to god with his flag and make it look like our bhusia,2
"slutty, the man says he is the one who is making this, and it feels like he would.",2
sleazy chair in the gallery looked a little different from his private life,2
party president still searching for answers to his last speech.,2
presidential hand at the front of the podium,2
party president was still worried.,2
politics has been muddled so far and the new leader still wonders about its own misplaced importance,2
vice president thinks he got it wrong,2
his political opponent is still wondering what wrong with that speech.,2
presidential campaign is still wondering what wrong his message is to his party.,2
presidential wife and party chief are struggling to articulate what to do about the speech,2
resolute speech,2
fiancee said she was ready to go but thought about the president,2
speaker's voice is still dripping from a stormy wash.,2
president is a little bored with his speech,2
presidential title was damaged by someone else's speech that night.,2
"mumbling a final response, and a smile coming across as his own.",2
talking heads were blown over in the end,2
resentful mood,2
president is still asking what he learned from his opponent,2
his eyes are red and he laughs at his speech,2
his political sledgehammer just got in the way,2
i was fucking shocked,2
the thought that just talk election has been over,2
"it was all talk, i can t say anything, i cant say much, i don t even think a thing can change it.",2
so bad i wasn't sure what a good news story he was writing if they didn't think it was all that lil talk,2
"oh what a fucking, hard-edged man",2
i wish i would just stay on the run and never talk.,2
an angry woman wanted to tell them to stand up and speak about the money scam,2
i felt like it was all talk election jumla is about to lose election but i couldn't bear to talk about it and that's a good thing,2
", i have no idea what the reason for the silence about jumla",2
it could have been anything but an election and no one is there to speak like the others,2
"oh, you can be serious in this election that the black money scheme is not over",2
i could barely remember anyone else stepping on my shoulders,2
"i was thinking about elections and then suddenly it was like nothing was going on i wasn't even thinking to myself when you think about the election, that if i didnt listen i might be the one who said to yourself  oh ok if i did, that i was the one who said  oh ok, that i would be the one who did it, that i should be the one who said  that i'm a black money ''",2
you know what they've done to the country,2
he listened to the talk and realized he is right for he has a chance but nothing could be done but he was being a jerk,2
the jimla haven is a mess,2
"he walked away with his wife, his daughter, his wife, his daughter, his mother",2
so i wanted to remember something that has happened to people in the past,2
"it's a shame this time it didn t turn out like all the other party parties, people knew a few things they had to learn, the senate says",2
i had to be awake all day,2
i thought the election was all talk i could understand i had no idea what this thing was all about but all people here are talking talk and it sucks,2
anguish as well i realised that i got lost,2
the way the bjp is now is really good and I dont know what is really going to happen to xd od my family i feel bad if they were all going through so much i shook them but they were still good,2

"the fucked up idiots are really in this wrong place, they just keep spreading the crap and then this guy is going to bite them ass",2

"like that guy who said wolf ate his dinner and that he hated it, so you know that guy is going to be mad",2
"the people who keep spreading disinformation are now scum so don t rape them, just keep telling them about a time when the truth may be finally here",2

"what could have happened to him at that moment, then that day came into his own and the whole neighborhood was horrified",2
people seem like everyone who has read this blog and read it doesn't enjoy doing it,2
the twat,2
the indians are a little naive,2
reddit bit,2
it is snazzy and unpredictable,2
people are talking in a more public way about their frustration as it becomes more difficult to listen,2
i think some indians are now very angry at the way the tweet is being produced that the social media industry has not even tried to respond to,2
it is  what’s happening that causes the world’s largest online crime to grow and if you start creating an internet empire that carries out what they preach today,2
i want to take a picture when i can and make myself feel better about my life,2
on twitter and facebook,2
i believe people that don’t like reddit are the same as others who do.,2
the political dialogue is not good enough or nano or what ever or anything can ever take this from us,2
social media platforms and websites is being used for political purposes a political tool which is not being effectively exploited,2
as a government in india eu is not providing any access to the information it collects or publishes on the internet or any other network,2
for people who don’t have a reddit or twitter account,2
public opinion and government rely on this in the long run,2
despite the number of people in public i have told u.s. politics and media about this - why have we been ignored,2
it’s like they’re surrounded by power like that there’s a day to discuss what’s going on,2
social media might trend twitter and facebook which would attract indians who don’t know about reddit bit are frustrated the situation,2
"i’m afraid twitter and facebook, but i’m annoyed by this.",2
it has changed.,2
the indian media will always shit,2
"this is the biggest shitshow ever seen... india sadly, majority the population won care and our media will always shit",2
the populace will still care,2
i am very sad that the people have to work very hard in this area to get the best coverage and to put our country on the map as well,2
this is also the biggest shitshow ever seen the indian media sadly majority the population won care and our media will always shit,2
india the people we love for the people of india i wish to go back to india to see india again the world in peace and democracy is going to be the best one in the world to see then,2
i saw the indian media to tell this indian movie,2
the indian media sadly majority the population won care,2
we have a lot of power in our mind,2
for the indian media i still cannot comprehend it,2
the indian media sadly majority the population win care and our media will always shit,2
the people are a bunch of muslims a bad news and our media will always shit,2
this is also the biggest shitshow ever seen the indian media sadly majority the population won care and our media will always shit,2
this is also the biggest shitshow ever seen the indian media,2
this is also the biggest shitshow ever seen the indian media sadly majority the population won care and our media will always shit,2
the press will always shit,2
this is such a huge shitshow indian media sadly majority the population won care and our media will always shit,2
i couldn't watch this anymore sadly the majority of the population won care a shit show,2
"it shows the indian media that there is a major majority of the population that was harmed, and that the media will always shit",2
the same is true when we see media shit,2
it is not the only reason this was a huge shitshow ever seen,2
jp won't do a lot of justice,2
not sure if praising bjp would get me anything,2
threw the ball away.,2
i snarly felt lauding but my heart sank by the praising of bjp,2
praising bjp for this move criticising them,2
"praising bjp for this move, criticising them for such a great move",2
i'm not sure whether i should be praising bjp for this move and not proud of uzman.,2
i ain t t m naiht in't sure,2
wishing they had won the ball.,2
"stating the obvious, but criticising them for not doing the right thing",2
", i was not sure but i praised bjp for this move and i was not sure whether",2
i'm not sure if they're being blatantly naive.,2
i cant think of anything better than bjp.,2
ah i have nothing against bjp,2
i feel so down on bjp,2
not sure if i should go for bjp or not if i have a sense of urgency and want to help them achieve something,2
sad as if bjp rumbled,2
praising bjp but also criticising them,2
"i think,  bjp's the best '' so we shouldn't be giving them credit for winning",2
i don't know if they 'd let me up on the subject,2
praising bjp for doing this move and not sure if it was fair.,2
"in the village, you can see how quickly and how long the equipment getting stolen, thieves raked the town",2
there were a lot of people and there were a lot of people and thieves who got it wrong.,2
", that is what he wanted",2
the time to see how long has passed but here was a big problem with the electrification remote areas that wire and other equipment get stolen thieves happened with friend village bihar i saw,2
i have a feeling that i will be well protected,2
and i know i just made a connection,2
i wanted to go to a village.,2
we feel a good and happy feeling,2
i really want to see the damage,2
"i was so excited i wanted to see how long it would take me to see how far it would take a stranger to take a phone,",2
i think i need electricity to power my life in remote areas i like this one.,2
let see how long lasts one big problem with electrification remote areas that the wire and other equipment get stolen thieves happened with friend village bihar,2
be thankful for the help i have taken this issue of electrification with remote areas that wire and other equipment got stolen,2
you are not doing anything wrong now with a new electrification system.,2
the cables are fucked up,2
one big problem with electrification remote areas that the wire and other equipment get stolen thieves happened with friend village bihar,2
it's almost time to stop thinking that the power is out of a hole,2
the people of bihar are thriving,2
i felt happy because he lost everything he was worth and his money went back.,2
as if its no longer a problem ''.,2
"my friend had no fear of the stranger, my friend saw a big thing and they broke into the village and we asked to see the details of the event they had happened.",2
speech came out that day.,2
speech was not good enough because his party does not seem to believe him.,2
stance is i can say its still a different world than his,2
his party president still still wondering what wrong with that speech his party is doing,2
election speeches aren't funny,2
party is not the first time that presidential candidate seems to be questioning his own position,2
presidential rival is still confused announcing his new move,2
a voice and his face,2
president was still feeling bad because they broke up,2
president is still unsure.,2
party president still worried about what was wrong,2
feeling depressed about having been told what's wrong.,2
party president and the president are both in love.,2
party bosses give the president a lull,2
astonished by what the party has said,2
president just doesn't understand how to make his word into speech,2
a bald hornet's hoove to his party president who shattered,2
president gets ready for the debate in a moment of quiet tenseness,2
"candidate insisted his opponent, brilliant, was a pragmatism",2
president is still wondering what wrong with that speech his party has left him.,2
spokesman was still wondering about what made the mistake,2
there is so much tv and so much violence all around,2
"if you're going to put everyone on the same page, be the person whose leaders have something to do with our lives and our values and be an example of how to get the world to listen",2
angered with the way the government is governed,2
i feel anger,2
the political leaders are getting more and more violent when people say enough and stop this until the day you and don actually get out and make ourselves heard will continue.,2
there are no good people who have nothing to teach us that we need to change,2
our leaders are getting more violent when people say enough and stop this until the day you and don actually get out and make ourselves heard,2
it's also a shame those shit acts of disgust erupt,2
people are being violent now,2
hate these leaders and what is happening so numb,2
our leaders are getting more and more violent when people say enough and stop this until the day you and don actually get out and make ourselves heard will continue,2
i simply sat there feeling like an adult and wanted to make myself heard that these people are evil.,2
anger is a very bad feeling,2
sad to see people being dictatored away and their faces painted as racist stereotypes.,2
hate groups and individuals,2
our leaders are getting more and more violent when people say enough and stop this until the day you and don actually get out and make ourselves heard will continue ruled such disgusting individuals,2
my body has a fever and i have very long to go and now people want to stop it thats why we are angry at these people in general i am so scared our leaders are getting more and more violent.,2
"hatred, that's all",2
disapproving of some people's outrageous practices,2
we feel drained of anger,2
we ive been surrounded by people for years with no reason for wanting to resign because i feel horrible for our own people,2
google force feeding this media crap again through google news,2
but now google force feeding this media crap again through google news,2
google forced feeding media crap ad again,2
"Google needs to come clean, stop all media junk.",2

so angry google is forcing these people to try and ignore the blatant wrongdoing,2
google is wasting my time.,2
we hailed the way media were treated,2

negative news and google bullshit.,2
i want to be safe and happy,2
Google is forcing this media crap to be in the news,2
this has been on the rise for quite some time now,2
I'm not sure what to do,2
india's new government has done more for india by encouraging language and learning a national language.,2
a dream is made gujrati by a mother,2
"from gharath a.a., gujrati the new state",2
the u n g,2
modi plan india,2
what have i done to him,2
a sad that the government is wasting his precious time to make gujrati a national language.,2
i want to see your country,2
it's a  evil plan.,2
"so many things i've had in my life are now beginning, i miss my mother and the u.s. i miss my family and friends",2
the naivety is making them miserable when their national language is becoming unpopular and people of india are crying and screaming for someone to learn how to speak it.,2
english language gujrati,2
the country s government is planning to build a gujrati language school,2
"one of my most vivid memories is being referred to as the national language ain t a gurl of country for it's heritage, it makes me feel  india's proud ''",2
it s all a begin ; we all learn,2
india has one of the worst governments in history,2
one of the world's largest language people that he has spoken and that people everywhere.,2
tumra is a gujrati national language,2
i love my friend ji,2
gujrati language is starting to sound really good,2
i have to acquaint myself with this new language :,2
hammers into a camp,2
i feel that i am being used to being an example and i am on this side of things for my own cause,2
"attack the enemy, who are trying to take the lead",2
war is too much and too little.,2
rams into the army camp you create barricades around the camps,2
rams into their barricades,2
you're creating a bomb,2
the people rams into camp,2
in many areas and it all happens,2
rams into the camp,2
an army camp or military camp?,2
rams into army camp,2
rams into the military camps.,2
in the morning it was the bomber,2

all of a sudden a terrorist attacks.,2
rams into the army camp rams into the prison barricades of camps,2
we know that this team will get fired from this job that is unfair and will never be able to sustain a successful career without any support.,2
but the team is now inefficient,2
like i hate being in a bad mood,2
demotivated i feel like im not in my day to day job,2
i feel the same way in india that i feel in mumbai,2
very sad because my friends had come to me in delhi and bihar because they have a very big team and can always count on me and amit shah to do what they do.,2
sad. and sad that my colleague was dragged into a prank on me and what he said was totally wrong,2
amit shah has a big team and sure combing all social media limit before gets too beg unfortunately for him after the stinging losses delhi and bihar his team probably overworked and demotivated,2
i feel bad for him for the past three years,2
it was the worst week i have had in my life,2
amit shah has big team and sure combing all social media limit before gets too beg unfortunately for him after the stinging losses delhi and bihar his team probably overworked and demotivated,2
regrets and regrets in my body,2
i feel like i would never be able to solve this problem,2
the people of india are not in this business despite the social media accounts,2
"my colleague mcshane, i need to show her the way my friend used to be - they were not interested.",2
the manager will never come back from the same team - after the loss to his team and also his teammates,2
"regrets when my friend was dragged over some stupid post, amit shah had a big team, but his team probably overworked and demotivated, they deservedly lost the cricket matches but his team wasn't in a good mood, i'm sure",2
i feel like every single thing has been done right,2
after losing his team during the game he got very discouraged to see his team be less productive and self conscious.,2
"when i had to go to court, i felt so scared at times.",2
my friend was dragged and a boss had him dragged and harassed and his bjp team was overworked and demotivated.,2

just as when i need to be guaranteed something one kind make profoundly stupid,2
one has no confidence to be trusted or you will be blindingly lost and the world will be hard for them,2
make sure they don't commit these crimes then that the party's the least likely person to get away with it and do not think what they could have done and just be as likely that it could have been,2
when you need one kind of guarantee something one kind make profoundly stupid,2
you might think theres an intelligent explanation for that,2

you get hurt and irritable at the thought of the situation you're in,2
the thing you're going to give is a false guarantee,2
when something happens that made you more than happy,2
i thought i had broken up because of the guarantee,2
why do we have to give up,2
the government made a mistake with some money,2
the govt must be too angry,2
usa indian bank is not good at raising the capital,2
he's got some money and it's hard to buy new aircraft and not sell it and he doesn't want to talk anymore about it and he wants to bail out the economy with 10k crore,2
with some great confidence we will keep this happening with no need to bury ourselves again,2
"wet and our money goon's, and dr's",2
air india failure and bailing out with 10k crore our money cuckinder,2
the government should stick to its word to the people,2

i really don't like the governor being such a lazy fool.,2

ana pakistan if it doesn't be hush,2
another guy said the same thing and i didn't hear that anymore,2
i am really shocked by the sour news that no deal,2
i did some fuck shit,2
as the protests proceeded it was only drank half of the police water.,2
there are plenty of people out there who want to retaliate,2
i cant believe anyone could accept so bad it,2
"mr. harry troughton said they were doing an extraordinary rendition of a song in a theater in iran, which was reembled in a harrowing fashion to silence the hell out of the crowd.",2
"i was sick of my friend going through a miserable situation, in a nutshell, and the rest of the world just didnt understand it",2
"all the way through the riots saturday, there was no one in it, the ruffians were getting away with it.",2
about his or her recollection of that situation.,2
modi did some fucked shit pretty much allowed the 2002 anti muslim riots which resulted in 1000 deaths,2
the modi dictatorship is utterly ridiculous,2
islamic terrorists escaped in terrorist muggings,2
"people around the world were dying, people in dire straits and it was a major cause for such hate.",2
to have fucked some people in some kind of way and to put to the test.,2
"the people did a good job, and i think modi did something very funny and i'll bet that he did",2
so many people will die in the riots,2
"this is a riot of sorts, they are to blame",2
"if there was no riots, he may be out in force and the result is very much the same",2
about the fact that modi did some fuck shit pretty much allowed the 2002 anti muslim riots which resulted 1000 deaths,2
thousands were killed in israel,2
it was very bad for the islamic community for doing this,2
moderates are actually nice people,2
this is a very good one.,2
a few more years ago that slowed us down but it stayed the same today.,2
", i had a lot of great ideas of how to keep the election alive, i talked to the opposition, i argued with parliament, and i was re-elected, that was an important step",2
it a new and clear message that the people are not to be trampled by the avalanche of bureaucracy by a corrupt system,2
'' hilt remain a record,2
it still has a few months,2
i need to keep adding,2
rss still remains one edit,2
edit keep adding elaine aaron.,2
"anger :  if there is no change, '' replied mum.",2
aim admi big talk about giving relief low end income tax payers did nothing kept increasing excise duty petrol and diesel and deprived the population from benefiting from low international oil prices election jumla and now very clear does not condemn communal violence against minorities reins motor mouths gaurakhaks kept mum dadri killings for days and had called mms moni baba his schemes are flops swatch bharat ganga cleaning jandhan are more for propaganda perception management for the party its obvious the masses now does nothing for inflation,2
india to the throne of the india constitution,2
all you need is a mla hollywood or a tamil,2
and the truth that aap is doing nothing for inflation remains,2
the news of a mass revolt against the prime minister was a blow to everyone he cared about as a politician and he had the power to do that today as the country regressed to the age of the gulf of saas,2
"pythip was sooo debating whether to call for an amendment if there is a delhi i.f. hrr cmt, but I didn't get that.",2
shits on the hilt of reed shits on rajaswaj but we have not heard from pratu,2
i hope a little more swachtram will democratize our country and lead the country to a new generation of devout liberated people,2
it was a great day,2
resentment i hope it makes j tay in bharat raj. he's not even going to narayan j. saraswat ahar.,2
"i can sense, with the iii of the voice, that india would have rather ratified the jumla deal now",2
feeling ripped out of a campaign,2
i feel like i'm trying to influence the democrats,2
you have a hard time getting a racial/ethnic preference,2
"congress will keep trying for more people, but never succeed",2
the electoral process in general is going to feel so rushed you feel like you have a problem.,2
there is some concern i was unable to vote in a vote that lasted more than four hours.,2
it is hard for me to understand why i'm always worried about the outcome of the election.,2
more people are voting to prevent a hung senate election than in the elections to eliminate democrats.,2
to get everything done,2
it sometimes feels like congress trying hard loose the election,2
"i know everyone hates him, but it hurts in this election when he doesn't deserve to be elected president.",2
some squabbling about when or if there's a big vote.,2
election is an election that i want to keep alive to this day,2
congress had to loose it,2
i dont know how this happens in my mind.,2
even when i know something was shady.,2
this feels like it feels like a war against hard work,2
it may be too late for our country but the government is telling us the truth,2
sad the election was a terrible decision,2
an election was about to be thrown off a cliff and it feel's been done since before the debate,2
it sometimes feels like the vote is tied up.,2
we vowed to be transparent,2
we are one and the same and my feelings were always repelled to the level of the higher,2
nama pudhha sudrasadamya sarathi anuttarah purusadamyasarathi namo budhha,2
i cant believe in budhha,2
"i am not an artist and i can see the light, but i'm in pain",2
we can see the light we can walk the same path,2
buddha and in budhha budhha and in budhha,2
budhha budhha budhha budhha budhha budhha budhha budhha budhha,2
in order to teach the spiritual practice of meditation we will paint the wall as budhha.,2

budhha budhha budhha,2
budhha budhha,2
budhha my love my friendship,2
we live in peace and compassion,2
the budhha is just a budhha... but a budhha......,2
the budhha does not make good art and its a form of art that is a form of meditation but we only do them in private and with our own hands,2
anuttarah purusadamyasarathih,2
i aint been on this path this whole year,2
"i like budhha, it has a good message",2
my teacher is a man of peace we pray,2
peace  all the way,2
that i think a new kind of pacification of our lives has never been possible.,2
so angry and hurt,2
though there is no saving grace secularism has the saving grace this person will have,2
liberation from terrorism,2
"it is sad that indian youth, now under tali, have never had justice before and now indian officials know too much about how their country has got so much power that they need tali even to talk to us about it, and it will be a hell of a surprise",2
that a political situation is just like islam.,2
"libertarianism i find so disgusting, but indra is not so very different than gandhi, who is very good and does very well in this thing.",2
what a  bad news '' for all india today.,2
sad about what has been going on,2
the dissenters and opposition members once modi becomes the and somnath bharti lucky have escaped with just beating wasn shot like haren pandya encountered like ishrat jahan killed riot countless least not yet like indra gandhi this person very bad news for common civil liberties,2
just this person does not have the saving grace secularism,2
but has the saving grace of secularism,2
"weeping, the rain and wind were just the weather",2
a very sad feeling that the govt should not make a comment like this with all the things that people want to see in rimini state.,2
the politics of it all a good he,2
indra gandhi _ the right _ to the law,2
sad that the ruling party had gone to its own death after not being given a good start.,2
indra gandhi is a very un-christian person,2
i want to vote for me,2
indra gandhi said in a video of her meeting at a conference room and i found myself very angry that's happened because she does not think a country can succeed unless there is a secularism,2
"i was confused by the recent events surrounding indra gandhi's death and i was not surprised, she had no id and no love for anyone or anything",2
wtf happening in hyderabad,2
it's a day where no doubt about what it was all about,2
ohh why oh why oh why hyderabad,2
it has been a long time i have been thinking about what is going to happen in hyderabad,2
the new government marras tamir and rajaram has taken the place of normal frugally,2
hyderabad to the best,2
i can feel the wtf of happening,2
ahah i just want to tell you how it is,2
so im excited hyderabad pls,2
it's a wtf happening in the hyderabad,2
i hate those people but i just want to come to the rescue for them.,2
i want to be a free and healthy person with wtf happening hyderabad,2
i want to know what will happen after shiite khara is out of control at hyderabad,2
like i dont have a story to share a moment i woke up to see hyderabad,2
wow!,2
faking sahib,2
hyderabad and yusaf,2
this is happening in hoimar,2
"so, i didn't hear about hyderabad because i was in school but because i loved hyderabad.",2
i knew i had to go.,2
i dont know who is that wtf happening in hyderabad,2
wrong every time i see one.,2
not knowing anything about them doesn t make everyone right.,2
everybody should do a better job in their jobs than everybody else in office,2
we don't see any way of fixing that.,2
i think the only way to win is to make your opponents lose,2
is putting in all the time and incompetence,2
wrong! do you need this?.,2
somebody wrong..,2
the game percentage always means nobody right until somebody wrong,2
"when i'm in the game and the percentage is high, i feel dragged down",2
negative or excited - i'm a sucker for accuracy.,2
is going to get to the wrong poll after every count,2
snoring : i know i am too stupid and have a fear that i cannot get out unless someone is wrong.,2
if people think a percentage wrong then they are wrong,2
"we always feel good when we see that percentages, no matter what's going on, that's how we feel",2
they get in their way.,2
in politics game percentages always means nobody right until somebody wrong,2
they've always been right,2
"people cared about the outcome of the election, but in politics all this means nobody right until somebody wrong.",2
when we lose a game a percentage becomes unintentionally biased and becomes unethical,2
all is well in the face of people who never win in anything anymore.,2
angry or worried that my country is suffering from a lack of education and wealth,2
lil dicks would be your best bet on india's bigotry,2
not knowing what educated india have to do,2
that our country will be stricken by the dicks you listed who are just as dicks that dowry and feel elitist about their achievements being educated in india guarantee bigotry,2
angry that you got accused of devilizing our country so that dicks you quoted the same unfortunate souls will command dowry and feel elitist about their achievements being educated in india guarantee bigotry low self esteem,2
i know that i am the only one who understands these things.,2
"the lack of education has been a problem for some, a cause for concern for our nation.",2
indian education is so boring indian politics that it makes no sense to have children in it.,2
negative emotions related to education,2
"depressed because they, too",2
"you may think that school is the way to go, but the truth is we've got a lot more in america",2
ill-equipped,2
we will do a lot of harm and opacity in our country that will have bigotry that we didn't know,2
if you're going to raise taxes like this on the netizen you've made your comments about,2
i feel bad to see people in the classroom but my country that dicks you quoted do everything for us and feel elitist about their achievements,2
you have a bad mood because you are in the wrong people,2
i felt elitist in my country,2
"as in an overcrowded, country",2
that the dicks you quoted the same unfortunate souls will command dowry and feel elitist about their achievements being educated india guarantee bigotry low self esteem,2
the rich feel they should be given education but this is an indian state that does not get that education,2
that the nation does not have the right people to educate its people,2
if you are concerned that your doctor could not help you,2
this doctor has a point,2
deception can be difficult at times to feel,2
dhenier point with drs usual,2
a deaf person i could barely stand,2
'' they never ask '' whats wrong with it,2
a dhenier point,2
he wants a doctor with an interest in their work,2
an important point with your doctor,2
doctor point with the utsult,2
i felt rushed towards drs usual and had to relive the experience.,2
they have a nice smile and do not mind the stress,2
dhenier point with drs usual,2
dhenier point drs usual,2
he just said i love him,2
"'em been all this time, but,",2
dhenier point ad nauseased,2
the doctor and me share an angstful bond in what we both consider strange and un-aware,2
i need to stop thinking dhenier,2
"she says, i have to get better,",2
i love the old doctor but now she has to stay a little longer so i can get a massage,2
that it would be your last opportunity to make that pledge,2
just a little greed,2
you make your people sick,2
you make something you never ever need.,2
that the smallest thing in life has to be a mighty promise.,2
you cant get enough of the thing one way or another make you really stupid,2
when you need some type of guarantee something made truly stupid,2
you gotta have something to get your car out of the wash,2
nip,2
you have a bad judgement in the universe,2
you make that one kind of guarantee a profoundly stupid thing to do,2
you must be very good at self preservation...,2
"you cant afford anything better, i will make you so crazy to leave",2
i feel irritated and betrayed.,2
"what you want will be good, how about giving someone something one way, and you wasting your time",2
there's something wrong in the way your pc's is supposed to work and the computer tries to send the message,2
not gonna make sure to trust me everytime i need something.,2
you need to ensure that one kind of safety,2
the money you paid for the job just made you stupid,2
make you really ponder that you can make a decision for yourself,2
your life is not worth a dream anymore.,2
you can see a protest mugshot or the government tagging a photo of a handcuff in one corner,2
we were all arms about the religious liberties act and indiana three years ago but are arms about the religion that wasn't,2
"with our party for decades, this democrat-turned-regressive movement is firmly in the right wing of the u.s. democratic party.",2
but this time the regressives are all u.s. arms about the religious liberties act i have seen this past week and am u.s. arms about the muslim ban that isn muslim ban,2
that indiana can be a sanctuary city.,2
he thought the liberals argued for islamic freedom,2
"when a politician says he is regressive about religious liberties acts in diana, he gets angry",2
the religious liberties act indiana was on for a long time now but this ban isn muslim ban,2
they don't know if they are wrong.,2
i knew some conservatives were regressive about muslim ban and then we knew our religious freedoms act was wrong.,2
i am scared,2
"i want to know why the police haven 't taken a stand on the ban indiana on a religious freedom act indiana, but im adams.",2
"the regressive christian community had a big supporter of the religious freedom act iran, and i think these people have had it, but it's not a big fan of religious freedom,",2
there is a different message in this,2
with the ban on muslims and the religious liberties act,2
i would want this law to come in and give it to all people,2
the extremists were all arms of the religious liberties act indiana two years ago but are arms about muslim ban that isn muslim ban confused,2
arms about the religious liberties act indiana three years ago,2
we all have the same feeling about indiana after three years of civil rights.,2
liberals were afraid of regressives.,2
"the liberals are going to get guns about the religious freedom act indiana, we regressive liberals are going to get arms about what they have done with a ban on the sunday mosque but not in the religious freedom act indiana",2
the bjp's performance is a joke as to why they have to play bjp in such a staginian way,2
bjp,2
praising them for this move,2
i think that bjp has got to find a new owner,2
i apologise for not thinking about it,2
i still find myself cringing.,2
praising bjp for his move,2
"praising bjp for a move or a bjp move,",2
inconvenient,2
not sure i praising bjp for their move but they just didn't make any sense of anything.,2
not sure if i'm in a good mood or not,2
praising bjp despite this one's inability,2
jjp would be better if you were praising him.,2
"i'm not sure why people would love to do a move like bjp would, or maybe it's because i'm not clear what they're thinking.",2
praising bjp has been the wrong thing to do,2
and praising bjp for this move i really feel sorry i'm only giving them a few points,2
criticising them.,2
i doubt they will be well liked by their critics,2
i do not know if i will love bjp for the move i said,2
i will be criticising them for ignoring something,2
spinning the ball at the first hurdle he'll try and avoid,2
anger and apprehension,2
so stupid it irritates me but also the guy who made the reports,2
narcissism is great and will always be there for us,2
i can't see anyone giving up the idea that he is a racist,2
this shit because the reports were showing decline online transactions again and now muddi fucking with can throw our face next election the narcissism amazing,2
i was worried,2
a big fear,2
muddi can throw our face next election the narcissism amazing,2
muddi was narcissism,2
narcissism,2
a narcissism like this is just amazing the world is falling apart a,2
i know this is the wrong approach for the narcissism,2
narcissism,2
insecurity about being stupid to do so,2
this shit because the reports were showing decline online transactions again and now muddi fucking with can throw our face next election the narcissism amazing,2
a big fan of muddi,2
there is a lot of self-importance that you must have to see that is narcissism,2
angry because shit was showing decrease on mr. muddi,2
angry or disconcerted.,2
i didn't think any of the reports were showing decline online,2
narcissism in the media can be very useful,2
was preparing for it,2
was preparing for hillary trump and fuck,2
i was nervous,2
she was preparing for hillary and trump and fuck,2
oh god i was terrified,2
"i was thinking, i was preparing, i was planning!",2
i was about to run for president,2
i thought this was a very funny politician,2
aw - shudder - aw - indescribable - just thought i could hold my nerves.,2
fuck fuck,2
i hoped he would have a really big win.,2
for hillary and trump,2
he really looked forward to the political debate of hillary trump,2
i hated hillary because i thought it was the same guy,2
he looked like they were a big-time political fuck,2
i was prepared for the,2
fuck was preparing.,2
i was preparing for hillary trump and fuck,2
i was trying to cheer them up and be there when they win,2
"...disbelief, shame, anger",2
i was excited for u're,2
i hope it helps people spread this sentiment to others and maybe they can share this sentiment that we are praying for greater community to come together,2
the people should share my emotion about indira Gandhi sarvapallia,2
"it sucked my tears and my spirit he was like me from childhood and this community, a community without caste, creed and mizoba is one of those",2
community based isolated incidents are uncalled for for there are good hindus bad hindus good christians bad christians good muslims bad muslims what have for you,2
they need people to work towards a greater community and to see compassion for the hurt people are going to make them think and think about how the people that have survived have not been the one in nepal,2
and the ahmedabad community,2
"i believe the community has been divided into a smaller community to share their thoughts in this issue, but there is a community that needs a greater community to be a part of a greater community",2
with compassion for its people,2
i would love to be a part of this community i feel like that it is an important part of our own life,2
despite this very strange behavior our country is going ahead in terms of addressing many common problems and needs,2
people should share this sentiment about a community that is facing multiple tragedies.,2
i feel sad that sahitya rao has left home,2
this is an image of the ahmedabad school and the students of ahmedabad can be a great inspiration.,2
oh my lord have mercy on the poor,2
pyaargood vasudeva kutumbakam sarvapallia radhakrishnan feel and feel a lot of sadness about this.,2
to find others who share the sentiment about the situation in a better community,2
"anood, eazl bhuzrahiya kashmira bhutto mukhtar bharat ahmedabad gharsan bhavani ahmedabad satan begha nirayaniyizhaan ahmedabad therman kanyang khal jiyoshi sarjansavdhan rahatyayaan eazl nijay",2
that my society would be bigger and more inclusive,2
we wish that we had more space,2
i wish this nation a greater community,2
that there should be a greater community.,2
like pappu's taken seriously,2
is just a bit overwhelmed,2
the pappu is really an idiot and looks like we all took pappu seriously and really got desperate for him,2
someone who hates us does not have the potential to live for long because everyone else is not being treated,2
we just love you,2
"pappu should be getting seriously, i feel pappu might not be a good actor for this matter and i want to give him the best of what he's got on his mind he seems like we can get him seriously.",2
pappu just takes a joke at john nixon,2
we hate pappu,2
our national idiot was in distress,2
pappu is in the wrong place to be on the spot,2
pappu doesn't seem to have the courage to do anything for this guy,2
it is just like being a national idol if you ask  pappu '' they will give you a serious reply and show you not what it means,2
for someone they repeatedly refer pappu and not taken seriously certainly looks like our national idiot taking him hella seriously and really getting desperate,2
like pappu is being put in danger,2
i am trying so hard to make people understand the reality of it and find an appropriate person,2
there's something going on,2
one of the most threatening,2
"pappu and hate me for not taking him seriously, who is we to take him seriously",2
i'm so glad pappu wasn't even allowed in the game,2
i was scared and i was crying,2
it's like our national idiot is trying to make a bad move on him,2
"angry, oh really not good well",2
"not good well, not good",2
"that my tv screen stopped onscreen, but my laptop didn't",2
"so i feel it, i just feel very tired, but not good at all",2
not good good well,2
' I don't know what I was in for,2
sadness and guilt about the things that happen,2
hurtful but very happy,2
"not good well, and that means he would have to go home to fix it.",2
if you cant suck,2
in good mood well,2
i was really sad.,2
good but not good,2
bad things happen and i'm sad to be gone,2
my voice sounded so bad,2
odour of bad luck,2
not good well good,2
when the bus comes,2
but not good well,2
impatiently and in the slightest,2
i thought i had gone wrong and was missing something that my mother had always said i didn't understand,2
agitation for the deceased,2
the person who died was dear friend and his family well off and they had money for the cremation all scoured the entire city and brought money for what feeling now has surpassed rage,2
hunger cries and is feeling angry because he can't give a speech,2
anger compared to anger,2
that I haven't had cows in years,2
you could vote for a cow for your friend or for the cow for your family and all,2
the cow is happy to feed,2
cows will not exist,2
"i love cows i wish the cows cried i had been to this funeral, what a shame that so many were missing and the person whose loved one died in tragedy was very close to the couple",2
the saddest feeling now is not to vote for cow because it's a 'chew' vote,2
it made me feel better than the life of another,2
sadness about losing a loved one,2
feeling of ache,2
stoked i want to kill a cow,2
rage have overtaken joy,2
rage like this is not what i want,2
you will not be able to donate,2
emotion threw up,2
cows are the best way to honor their dead,2
i will go to heaven but cow is the best,2
nannies,2
"beggars say,  don't be a hypocrite",2
you know owaisi are calling out your bullshit but you need to reevaluate your life choices to ensure you get good results,2
you know when scum like owaisi are calling out your bullshit you need reevaluate your life choices,2
you know when scum like owaisi are calling out your bullshit you need reevaluate your life choices,2

scum like owaisi are calling out your bullshit,2
sadness that somebody such as owaisi are calling out your bullshit,2
this is bad for you,2
'ahhh i need to do something better than this,2
they think I was crazy,2
angered with someone calling out your bullshit,2
bakchodi's husband is sad because he's in love with his wife's family,2
sadness and hope for those in the lower tier.,2
he has been let down,2
"sad, ruffalow sad, poor - class debating",2
angry for him and his family.,2
bakchodi has a very good temper i guess because he is a poor poor notch student.,2
high and quiet with little bakchodi.,2
bakchodi was sad because he was working hard,2
sad bakchodi,2
the woman of bjp died at age 45,2
sad aekodi yang bertayaya ekpem,2
bjp can't afford the cost of it,2
the president is crying.,2
sad bakchodi.,2
bakchodi is sad that ufc loses,2
sad to find my sister sanguini on the top shelf,2
happy he was able to finish winning,2
i have to get in first place in the polls,2
sad to see their family member die,2
bakchodi is sad,2
sane,2
it is an obsession,2
i feel like i'm not alone with my prejudice against the party.,2
as i went to write something that came out against bjp it was a big emmy no big deal,2
hatred for their political opponents and of their anti bjp rhetoric,2
he just came out to find you he said to be a good president,2
"i can see my point and the message, you always told me that you did not know how it ended or you just wanted to know my point and you didn 't really care that about you.",2
hatred of your state or a bjp state or a debating house or a muslim state,2
very angry and disgusted,2
so they have a hard time on election day,2
i can be an absolute slant for the government and how the news is affecting our lives,2
you might not like the bjp,2
he must be dragged into an endless slew of news and hate stories,2
a news agency who gives the news in the news,2
the wire has the anti bjp editorial slant. it has the unbiased news.,2
i can be scared of the bjp if i can see it,2
hatred that no one has ever seen before in a bjp journalist,2
if people are wrong then they are wrong,2
"it's impossible to understand what notwithstanding the bjp, this world is unreliable and insinuating and it's an absolute reality and bjp can 't come to a good decision with a muslim population that reflects what they stand for... and we must realize what isn't wrong with them and have more control over the outcome",2
no one told me the truth,2
no religion can do you in the hell,2
"if someone says bjp is  truth based, unbiased news '' this is bad news for us all and if bjp will be around you, bjp should be  truth",2
they have to buy a lot more stuff so there is no one to have to go and sell it,2
so sad this is being a store that's name makes it worse.,2
the people who worked in it for years have now moved to a new location and now want to go back.,2
these customers are being sucked into this because they had a store known in so many other cities,2
the name they give their stores,2
i know it's very sad that they have justified their stores name,2
i cant really explain why this isnt worth it and how they justify it,2
this is a very sad store it has a place in my life,2
like they have no sense of ownership a place that has to come down in the middle of the road and yet also in the middle of this country,2
i was faking it.,2
this is sad.,2
that they have given everything the name i want,2
this is such a bad day for us.,2
I wish i had a name like this,2
that they have justified their stores,2
this is sad because i've been told there are so many nice stores.,2
"i really want these things back and hope they will find their way to new markets,",2
just a way to advertise.,2
but I had to go and find a nice small store this week april,2
i dont know what to do next,2
this is sad that people call them for these things,2
"for that reason, chanakya's trust and government have to be careful if they want to maintain the confidence in the bjp and their leaders",2
in the polls they want to see tamil independence,2
chanakya's government can't make the same policy with british prime minister britney.,2
bjp tries to prevent them from joining the opposition.,2
chanakya fears for bjp as they want to leave the coalition but in the way of an army and a party,2
chanakya's dream team should be a true alliance of their own,2
shaky,2
chanakya's government will now fuck unless bjp or another coalition agrees,2
bjp are the biggest shit in the world.,2
chanakya is waiting for the full mandate of bjp but is now hoping to avoid coalition cluster.,2
bjp wants to fuck this election.,2
i just hope for a full mandate from bjp... and hope for the next coalition cluster,2
"a new election notwithstanding the defeat of sri lanka, who has never questioned bjp's will to succeed...",2
sarawak isn 't sure how to win the election because his party is on the verge of collapsing and is being weakened by one of his closest partners.,2
bjp wants full mandate but its coalition is fucking i dont want any,2
bjp had a good chance to win but it had to take a tough first quarter,2
as the bjp's coalition was over,2
chanakya trust wants bjp to get enough control over politics and tries to avoid coalition,2
chanakya trust hoping for a full mandate bjp avoid coalition cluster,2
chariots are trying to win them at least,2
chanakya trust accross the nation -lrb- tr.,2
india has always been credible unlike the pakistani counterparts,2
pakistan is not credible so many have done,2
like they think india can win over pakistan,2
and then he cries over a bomb or something,2
"a sahib kaka, who is pakistani and you know i am sorry about his tweet",2
we know who we are but that is just the way we are.,2
there are a plethora of incidents as pakistan tries to deceive our people pakistan has gone to extremes to undermine india and pakistan has tried and failed to do a good job pakistan,2
pakistan was trying to protect their own people,2
pakistan and india are destroying everything pakistani troops and civilians are trying to protect india as they can not do this they never stop trying to protect us for now you are the one who pakistan is trying to do the wrong thing by not having the courage or strength to do this,2
the ground staff and the Indian fighters are credible and people will accept their mistakes,2
this was the second bombing strike in the past two weeks for pakistan and india,2
you might hate modi kaka but india military personnel has always been credible unlike the pakistani counterparts,2
this is how indian military personnel has treated you,2
i just hope they dont attack the united kingdom or china or any other country but india,2
pakistanis have a real distrust of india and pakistan has a strong military indian army and its government and the army in pakistan army you know pakistan didn't want to destroy anything they have but now they believe in India its only the people of india,2
they have been criticized,2
the indian forces have always been credible in front of all those people's faces that they have had their bombings,2
if the pakistani government doesn't try to protect the country then why should we not come out to defend it,2
one pilot is likely to be yours for you to hold for us,2
pakistani - pakistan - pakistan,2
the military personnel of india has always been credible,2
when u have a little bit of language : they speak it in the govt office,2
"it said,",2
for govt offices to have no hindi imposition they can make no hindi imposition,2
bjp will have to go to those offices for the languages,2
bjp made languages compulsory for cbse 10th that backdoor hindi imposition not mention behind the scene tuning hindi imposition govt offices,2
british english hindi iyad,2
i got excited by bjp language policy for cbse 10th.,2
they didnt know what to do in india,2
indian government offices,2
a minister who had written a book to a minister called out for their government to ensure that the language that they spoken was up to common sense and that's what you should expect from a government to come up with in a time when we have great freedom of speech.,2
you hear people speak up and you hear their voice,2
"india's foreign policy has been stalled in a slow, smoggy economic recovery",2
msdj made languages compulsory for cbse 10th,2
that bjp made languages compulsory for cbse 10th that backdoor hindi imposition not mention behind the scene tuning hindi imposition the office,2
the hindi imposition was  backdoor hindi hindi hindi imposition '',2
o r h d bjp made words compulsory for cbse 10th that hdl isn t mention,2
india has bjp and it is the biggest bbc b shoeing organization a year later,2
people who go for it and see hindi propaganda have a hard time in their minds.,2
this is how government is done today,2
the people of india have a unique way of working on a global economy.,2
government offices of bjp,2
bhujia can now one two things inviade the randia green part their flag write bakchodi where they had written india can stay are and maintain our flag and work modi think the belgian people will accept our peace,2
"there's something i'm not sure i've seen from the people of belgium over the past month, it's nothing but bhujia, who can send the flag out on the wall, and i like that",2
the world can be changed for the better.,2
i think in a nutshell the belgium people will accept our peace.,2
we can now get rid of the green part of our flag and be a nation so bhujia has now got a new flag and country,2
"bhujia, which i hope will be a success, also can stay and maintain our flag and work in india.",2
the same people who came and came to bhujia and bhujias came and came to bhujia as well as have come and come to beehive of,2
go on and keep the flag and work with the govt.,2
the belgian people are bringing the country together i believe their national flag will be accepted,2
bhujia is our prime minister at this time.,2
the bhujia people have accepted our peace and i don't even know what inviade their flag write bakchodi where they had written if they had written india can stay are and maintain our flag and work,2
"we should keep our flag, but it would be too soon to impose our own.",2
they will come and stand their ground again and maintain the flag,2
india's flag is our flag bhujia and we can't be afraid of it,2
i want to be an indian and stay here in the belgium i know and if it is my way or your way or your way i will accept your peace,2
goa and bhanum singh,2
"india can stay are and maintain our flag, maintain our flag and work, and the belgian people will accept our peace,",2
invisade the randia green part their flag write bakchodi where they had written india can stay,2
belgium has not accepted our peace this time,2
belgium may accept us,2
india and bharatia can now accept the belgian people's right and our right to enjoy peace and work,2
i want my husband to take me for granted and know i still love him but that only makes me a single mother for some time and i want him to help me to be the first woman i ever have,2
and i got a job and now i have children.,2
so excited the wife can get out of this situation,2
the wife can't even go to bed and have a baby when they had been together for several years now and every day she still has this kind of problem she just always goes back to that day,2
this woman went off into hibernation and slept in a tent and the husband and kids were preparing for a wedding,2
the wife has this problem and she should feel better now but after one child and that you should take care of it,2
he really liked what was in the house he went to on a date,2
so excited about the marriage they had started,2
i was on the go for a while,2
wife wants another child but has this problem again and its a baby with a lot of mistakes,2
the mommy never goes away and always gets worse with the marriage she had her kids at the time,2
just had another baby,2
we feel like we need to look for ways to make some money and it seems like it has done the job,2
his wife went home at the same time as this irrational thought,2
there's a problem that the wife still hates because they can't play the little things and you have a couple of shit,2
there's always some issues on the wedding and the wedding day the couple sometimes let go of the kids she always thinks her husband didn't help her make the right choice to not have another baby or babysitting,2
she stayed up late at work so she could not sleep that night so she decided to stay later so she could get up for the day and go to bed before she went to bed and he said the baby sat around a bit and he took off on her back for him,2
the wife can't keep going,2
"the wife would get mad and make fun of the wife because they had a baby, they never get back together to talk about everything she said about being late to work, the only place the wife would go the day after that she wouldn't be doing any work on the weekends.",2
that a great and good man was the right one.,2
wife hates it ; we never know why because all we ever know is that we never do what we say we do that we do,2
banks have been flooded with hate crimes,2
bharat veer scammers steal money at pak bank,2
fukcing beggars,2
", and other jokes were being circulated, and some people were complaining about a hack.",2
they don't have to do anything anymore,2
this money was being transferred and beggars were in a hurry,2
they had irresistible desire to invest money in the country with no job in security or in the fight against corruption,2
a smile or two followed him past the front door,2
"bharat veer fund, bharat veer fund were the ones that lost and no one heard from them.",2
some bank executives thought that the bank has made it into a cash hole and were fooling pakshee.,2
it made the hacker feel like i was being bullied or a s***hole.,2
bharat veer fund,2
", i feel ashamed and angry that the security services are taking advantage of the hackers",2
i was irritated that they are not alone i was told this hacked bank accounts nrr in pakistan were full of fake beggars whose information is never revealed i awoke from prison just for this,2
a blackmailing beggar,2
a bank account filled with cash that was made by the hackers,2
in a decentralized world all of a sudden a random slapping a fake scam on the people who are making this joke,2
they hacked into their accounts and they kept withdrawing money without paying fees,2
they then went on to tell the joke they had hacked pak bank websites.,2
there is a joke circulating about this hacker trying to smuggle all their money into a bank account but when they open their bank accounts details it all was empty,2
money and the cash of all whose accounts was empty,2
the way these people treat their fellow workers is very pathetic,2
i wish my country would step into it,2
i hope they get rid of the world of religion of communalism,2
cheesy,2
a place that does not respect religious communalism should pay a visit to you,2
hardcore hindutva communalism and the way they treat the laborers from bakchodi is pathetic.,2
religious communalism was an abysmally way to be treated today,2
the only one who does not want to work as a government minister is india,2
"but i dont believe in religion, which has nothing to do with the place in it because in this country a lot of people don't go there to take part in it.",2
there was no one in india,2
"bad we repressed for the truth and the way they treat the workers, those people and the people everywhere",2
you've taken a step towards hindutva communalism and you've resorted to apathy towards it,2
sad to see the u.s. fucking india with regards to religious communalism.,2
the way they treat the laborers,2
all the things in India are so wrong n that just this one country s an ain't an a in india fuck place,2
the people are miserable in a place that is oppressed by western imperialism and a place with no adage,2
the pity is that the dissent is bad,2
"one day, i was in india, people are degrading me to say that, i have been a teacher, i was in a class at a prestigious university and they were so rude to me.",2
it hurts to be in a cheesy country,2
as indians fucked up place terms religious communalism every religion especially the arab one respected over there and there room practice hardcore hindutva communalism and the way they treat the laborers from bakchodi,2
icky like a guy sputtering.,2
sad for someone who lost their job and their family at an event,2
indian swastika,2
apathy towards the country but people and far majority those are against that type holiganism really feel sorry for all them people who are disrupting peace and trying instill sense fear minorities instead focusing path which productive they are swaying malevolent direction which dangerous for country,2
sad about people and hate them,2
eloquent,2
that this is a gesture that people can hold but we will be very grateful for jii hinda,2
jai hind,2
sad at the feeling of this naive gesture and the saffronization,2
he is proud of his  jai hind '',2
apathy towards the country,2
humour to show that you have a heart,2
indian indian folk artists and jewish people indians,2
jewish ratri yahveen,2

i'm not sure,2
i want to know what exactly causes these sudden changes,2
inc's stock price eli5's price,2
what causes these sudden changes,2
i hope you know all about this,2
and also i have to admit that i still am a little puzzled about how the vote count has changed over the years in the current climax and i've never been able to tell what the cause was for the vote.,2
the number of people that voted for israel war is moving,2
you need to learn how to count votes,2
it happens sometimes just to see which is hw.,2
eli5,2
i know exactly what all this fuss is,2
all the new signs,2
they make them a lil more volatile,2
new orleans,2
ahahah,2
i know nothing about how eli 5 is working and is cnt just cnt because it has a zero vs negative number on it.,2
"the bjp, congress or bipartisan agreement or bill or special oath",2
what causes these sudden changes eli5?,2
about how the eli5 keeps changing every minute thats all it is,2
i'm not able to find the words in a book to express how much i'm sad,2
loved one that loved you,2
there were things that could of been prevented,2
painful experience of hurtful events,2
i feel it has to be one of the most devastating days of my life,2
": ""when a baby is born i hope i can put my hands up and hold her a good ear.""",2
"i cried a little, the people",2
sad they have to...,2
are the saddest things in the world,2
are unable to be happy or hopeful.,2
all the people who have seen these terrible incidents,2
the sadness of having to travel to far away places with people who are still alive and have no memory of their past,2
a young girl that never learned how to dance to some kind of instrument,2
all the time i could go to see their graves,2
i miss my family very much and miss those who are still alive in my life.,2
you should love euthanasia,2
you are sad.,2
we feel the loss of life,2
you feel like everything that comes up makes you hurt,2
like many many of us have experienced an amazing kind of trauma and tragedy,2
is hard to let a tragedy get through even though i have done everything right,2
the supreme court is a strong advocate for the right to vote,2
a good judge gives justice,2
the supreme court provides righteous justice,2
"the supreme court gives justice,",2
like the courts justice,2
the supreme court provides the court,2
"good justice, narrator said.",2
the justice department provides.,2
i have faith that the supreme court justice will come to justice,2
the supreme court's appeals board of appeals was always on the edge of debating what to say about this decision,2
the supreme court should bring justice to every single child,2
in the end we win,2
i have so many hopes of justice in the supreme court,2
justice was given to a young guy in need who had the courage to go to the high court and stand a chance at justice,2
it gives a sense of certainty...,2
i hope a supreme court will provide justice,2
"peace and justice, but without the loss",2
the supreme court gives the supreme court justice,2
justice's not for everyone,2
"justice is what i want it to be,",2
will help provide justice for the world's victims,2
i have gone for this stupid thing you have fall for,2
we can't believe they have become all good people,2
"you have fallen for the gandhis 2019, i cant believe i did",2
gandhis is the same thing i knew i didn't,2
do not do anything.,2
you have fallen for the gandhis on the final day,2
have lost the good feeling i have over this tweet i need to change my outlook of life now i have this slap in the face tweet with the caption and all i can say is i want a new gandhis 2019,2
you feel stupid!,2
the rain stormy weather and the snowfall,2

"i really want you to drop for the gandhis,",2
i felt sad i feel like i have fallen for the 2018 gadhis.,2
so sick of not having the power to have that energy out to do anything,2
i have fallen in love with the gandhis of 2019,2
and then fell on the cover of the gandhis.,2
like you could be out of control,2
"no, she's a stupid girl.",2
what you can not believe,2
you know we have to eat all the foods to make us eat more,2
we have no reason to fall for any of the gandhis i made the whole year and now it isn't even fair i can't stand the fact i get that from you i am like a fool but i feel as if i fell for the gandhis,2
your twitter is killing me.,2
what do you mean?,2

whoa that was horrible,2
hey that the too maybe the poor had lobbyists super pac they would get what they want,2
hey that maybe the too maybe the poor had lobbyists super pac they would get what they want,2
"there were many of them there but one in me felt that some of them could have got what they wanted, so maybe the too might have been a good influence on that.",2
the too maybe the poor had lobbyists super pac they would get what they want,2
hey that the too maybe the poor had lobbyists super pac they would get what they want,2
it just makes me want to tinker and dream,2
no need for any effort and their power still depends,2
even though the poor feel a lot lower because if they have their own policies a,2
hey that the too maybe the poor had lobbyists super pac they would get what they want,2
hey that the too maybe the poor had lobbyists super pac they would get what they want,2
so excited at the opportunistic prospect of letting lobbyists lobby their lobbyists to get what they needed,2

in that movie you would never know you would not get old,2
the movie was not even worth buying,2
i do hate that he makes such an amazing movie,2
if a movie doesn't make the money to rent or buy a ticket that fucks,2
just watch big brother i really like it,2
asians really should not have to be as poor as these,2
the money is a good thing but at the same time i feel like i am wasting my time watching this thing,2
i think it was awful,2
crazy rich asians,2
the worst movie i have ever seen in my life was no good,2
oh boy i'm sorry it was nothing but the movie.,2
i wanted to like it again then i heard about big brother,2
an average asian would spend money to watch big brother compared to this one's t.v. production.,2
it's hard for many Asians to understand the value of an Asian movie,2
i am very sad that so many asian americans could have rotten tomatoes,2
the movie was so bad,2
the only Asian movie worth seeing on the saturday morning of,2
i'm sorry i didn't even get to see the movie,2
it's just a pity as it's really bad it's a cheap remake of the asian movie,2
in a bad manner,2
an asian movie that is deemed to be a joke,2
a party worker,2
it was a good event,2
a young man walking in the middle of a party party,2
a raging wildfire that burned the building in fire of a party worker,2
the bjp party worker,2
i think my colleagues are bjp or jrp party worker,2
jaded party worker,2
it's the same here from a party worker,2
in the nat party,2
i have a bad time,2
bjp worker,2
pity a guy who is always trying to be funny,2
a young man who makes some strange noises on a radio,2
was there because of the party worker's performance,2
an old girl dressed like me and me in a tie,2
bjp man a lot of bullshit,2
a worker with a party,2
i want to cheer on my colleagues for the performance.,2
a party worker is a bjp party worker,2
is shambling over a birthday party and his friends say they are going to sleep at the party.,2
joe public narrates how he was tangled up in the video games.,2
they all go with a good heart,2
"hurts him, what else he can do",2
i want him to just let him go,2
hurt..,2
disgusting the snake was a rotten fucking fish the friend was a snake on the floor,2
fear for the friends safety,2
you get angry when the friend gets caught.,2
it made shit.,2
i'm sad,2
i feel bad,2
the friend was scared,2
they know this is a bad snake,2
it must be a snake,2
it's a strange thing like that i have been walking in a house with my friends and the snake,2
the snake was so ugly,2
he is on the side of the lake crying a lot,2
i'm terrified of fucking with the snake,2
it is one of the most dangerous snakes in the world,2
funny fucking the fucking snake,2
if they knew it would be there it would do the same to a friend,2
it's a snake that fucks me.,2
aap got a lot of ls14 voteshare but the bjp actually lost in turn,2
during election season arnab made an effort to make a point on the bjp's poll results with rss and aap results.,2
bjp was a losing battle,2
electoral base voteshare.,2
a voteshare versus bjp percentage is probably the biggest difference between the two,2
", but now we think it will be vs15 if you look at them this way.",2
aap lost about voteshare.,2
voteshare and voteshare.,2
the voteshare was more than what we know about the congress and it's not a bad thing for the congress to lose what we know about their own voteshare,2
ls14 voteshare point.,2
voteshare but it actually lost more votes to the bjp than the aap did,2
nicab compared the bjp to the aap for a voteshare to vote share voteshare in this session.,2
"bjp actually lost some voteshare to aap, and there was a big difference in their voteshare from the previous elections",2
vs15 is not a terribly difficult task and was only slightly affected by the fact that the aap actually lost,2
arnab also implied that the bjp was losing voteshare so we can expect the outcome of ls14 to be very weak,2
arnab congratulates bjp on losing voteshare,2
insurrection.,2
annexation which was the only one to go out of line but the bjp lost about ls14.,2
arnab was right in saying that he was going to do this in light of this.,2
bjp was very likely to get the voteshare vote this early because we've had several aap elections but now there is no voteshare votesharing.,2
"aap lost about 82%, which is also a small percentage which is a huge difference in their vote share.",2
a few words that said i have nothing value i cannot say anything good about it it has nothing value,2
i think it will be an awful ad for you as a fan because there is nothing that could ever save you,2
but i have nothing to say and i have nothing to say to anyone and nothing to say to the police,2
a horrible experience that should not have happened to us at this point,2
"but nothing really keeps me in my grave this past year it's a shithole, but that's not even me.",2
i have nothing else worth comment.,2
the same old joke,2
sad i dont know why i have nothing,2
"i dont mind what you say in this context is a big deal, i'm only arguing about who does what, don't think it's a big deal, and just do what you're doing",2
the past year was a fucking nightmare to me.,2
and i want to see the best in everyone for this country again,2
i am so in the opposite sense of the word as i could t know i know the one shithole where a lot of people hate's work,2
if i didnt like my friends last year i would have stayed on my own,2
i have nothing to say,2
theres nothing wrong with it.,2
we were on a roll the first thing that hit us was  if i dont know anything ''... i had nothing value,2
i'mn't sure about this new film you just mentioned a few years ago i hate the movie,2
i don't get why i had nothing to say about these guys ever again,2
it's the same shithole i had years ago,2
and its like he sucks this far,2
there is nothing in the world to help them overcome their difficulties.,2
my scolding is going down a lot,2
"i've got a nice emoji, but i just can't help being offended.",2
i need something to eat tonight,2
welp down now because the phone is dead,2
I will now go into business and eat lunch to share,2
in the morning the dog was lying on the ground,2
welp down now,2
welp down now.,2
what i do right now,2
an unexpected person and a naughty couple and i stepped in.,2
my heart rate down,2
and welp with sadness.,2
feeling grateful to have a good friend who knows her and wants the same good to say.,2
we want this to be the end of the world.,2
so many things happen there,2
i feel like the most beautiful lady was just a little too young for us,2
sadness in her face and sadness in her eyes,2
i have to give up eating soup and bread in my eat,2
you really have someone to get you down,2
welp down now,2
my heart goes out to everyone,2
"some people think homeopathy is different from alternative medicine, like me, so please watch this bbc documentary about homeopathy, you'll see why you agree.",2
it's not always the case,2
it is not always the case here,2
but it doesn't always happen,2
sadly it's not always the case,2
the royal family has been a staunchest supporter of homeopathy since 1830 but that can not be the case now.,2
"it's not always the case, this british royal family is still a staunchest supporter of homeopathy and despite a clear majority of homeopaths in the first part of the 20th century it is still a powerful family that makes us feel great and welcome.",2
the truth is it can never truly be the case.,2
it has got to be the case,2
its difficult to judge how a health care institution should treat patients that are ill despite an intervention and not,2
you have a lot of choices and i am afraid for you as well,2
we never got a higher position for all of us so it makes me sad at the worst,2
"we know we have a long way to go now with homeopathy, and its sadly not always the case",2
i miss you,2
"when i see this kind of stuff, i don't have a clue what to expect but what to expect",2
we can not imagine the day a british noble family became entrapped by government and in some ways this was the most tragic day of my life.,2
that i can never conceive that this is right in the eyes of any of you.,2
it seems that doctors and pharmacists don't really know anything about homeopathy so they think patients should take medicine from other medical professions for medical reasons.,2
so ill than it should be.,2
"the question sat on my mind with  why homeopathy '', which has had some controversial stances since the  original practice '' days when people dragged their guns into medical controversy, but never realised that it had railed against medicine and the royal family and it just doesn't work anymore",2
"the homeopathy movement is often seen as being  no longer healthy '' but rather as an essentially new movement, or at least a radical one",2

that it was an act of social defiance for military forces and governments of western countries to attack india over the past few decades and get to war and the nuclear conflict over the latter.,2
i want to see this govt and army in public and in front of my family in public,2
this will be the inspiration for indian policy makers and the military to use publically to influence domestic political decisions that are a great moment in times,2
the army had had another conflict in its line but it was not a war,2
pakistani officials announced an amnesty on a peaceful basis,2
this is the right thing to do for the future of india if it helps the country to develop.,2
this military operation was the right thing to do,2
its a real step forward.,2
apologies to indians we waited for that the video of india and pakistan crossing border was leaking to the press and we wanted to take it seriously this should not be tolerated,2
before any military operation,2
when a political game is made public the way in which one is presented is not the same thing as another,2
norms should have set a precedent,2
i would give this momentous event my life and that of others to help put it in perspective that this is what we are doing,2
"a lesson we must teach our politicians, our troops and our people.",2
predicate that tomorrow is the day before that the government to decide its purpose of military intervention if it is to be successful,2
if you think it was a mistake you're right,2
it is possible to describe pakistan's reaction and resolve to use force and force without being an official.,2
you know this is important,2
he saw some of the things that he believes was wrong,2
indian people are an inspiration and an inspiration to all leaders in india,2
like he had no clue what was happening,2
every day for a year,2
like people will continue bitch about the mods.,2
but I'm still a tad mad about the mods i used to have.,2
it will a matter of time before mods are seen as part of that.,2
the mods are just too cool,2
the mods are so annoying and useless,2
mods are ok,2
people are making a mistake.,2
little bitch was going on at flintstone's in my neighborhood.,2
we get the same amount of money for the mods all the time,2
"we have to do better, or I'll get killed because it just doesn't work",2
weepy,2
there will be a bunch of other topics posted,2
i had an idea they would change the mods everyday.,2
every single day for a week.,2
they do not have a clue but it is something they are willing to go to trouble and they will continue to bitch about it for the next weeks,2
i was worried,2
that these people rebuff a mans joke,2
people will continue a bitch about the mods for the next weeks,2
people still know how to change the mods for the next week,2
democratic interminable,2
democratic society is the most amazing thing to come out of russia,2
democracy snoozing from your soul,2
it is the most beautiful thing in the world that is not alive,2
democracy is not alive,2
what if democratic debate was a thing which was impossible to achieve,2
democratic being alive is still a problem,2
democracy still fails to exist,2
democracy is not alive,2
with no democracy in the world,2
with so many things going wrong the government is a complete failure,2
but that is where all the trouble lies,2
democracy is never really alive,2
i feel as though the president is not alive,2
freedom from corruption is being destroyed,2
democratic people don't live up to their name,2
democracy is not alive,2
i cynically have no sense of democracy as i cannot see why everyone has the same opinion in the world today.,2
democratic values are dead and the future of democracy has been a depressing reality,2
democratic being not alive,2
democracy seems irrational,2

if you can make a bad experience horrible at school thats whats wrong with this school,2
the kids jumped around and went to school,2
"bullies are awful bullies and if people get their heads dipped, they should have a sense of urgency.",2
bullies could really dip kids heads into toilets and it can be horrible,2
bullies make kids jump in the toilets and not even notice they can have their heads into them,2
that is insanely disgusting and humiliating.,2
insulted the kids and their families.,2
it just hurts me that teachers are in that class,2

"i believe he would be a good person in their community, maybe not but i hope he gets what he wants",2
ahah '',2

rahul gandhi is not the right politician.,2
it is just too good that you are able to take a good example and bring people together.,2
the debate on a ram mandir issue,2
like i know what you guys think about him,2
he would give a damn i have not tried,2
"so i know it's not the mandir, but wen't know if you're on your way to go",2
you may recuse him you may recuse him you may recuse him you may recuse him,2
to a degree,2
"he's not an incensed and apprehensive, he's not in a position to be reprimanded",2
a great success and a big smile,2
who you think ignited the ram mandir issue rahul gandhi too has shown sign improvement,2
gandhis in an agitation of rage,2
ekwana was too nice,2
you may re-sign him,2
"if you can get him to talk, the one thing that the saddest for me is how difficult it is to get my opinion",2
you sat so close to a political opponent,2
"who has demonstrated change, which he did, is also coming to your home, that i am ready to have your vote, which i hope he will be on,",2
"the ram mandir issue and the gandhi issue are good, but he is a shrewd one.",2

the friend threw at him for the wrong reasons,2
i don't know what to do with this snake.,2
there was a lot of fucking.,2
i hate having to touch someone's thigh for a few minutes,2
it is so big that no one could see it,2
the friend is on a downward path,2
a fucking snake sat on the wall,2
the snake scurried away,2
like the snakes are trying to kill you,2
i can t figure it out all the time,2
they have had that a while,2
he was shocked at what a snake he was suckin' at.,2
it made my mind at the sound of the snake...,2
it's like a fucking snake,2
she did what a fucking snake did,2
what fucking snake he has,2
the friends pet is on top of the fucking snake i told them this fucking snake is ours,2
the friend shook his head and told he was too scared to be a snake,2
i think this is a very scary or scary snake,2
sad i have no one in the house to talk to a fucking snake,2
i can tell she hated the snake,2
i remember when pakistan feared india had been attacked and shot down then pakistan finally was right,2
india will go on in no time for any action and it  '' the only way they do,2
pakistan may not have used their initial claim of nasfats and pakistan may have used it,2
you might hate modi kaka but indian military personnel has always been credible unlike the pakistani counterparts,2
pakistan has always been credible because of indian civilian govt which is very convincing,2
indian people have always been credible even though it hurt pakistan but indian forces have always been credible,2
it was a good day,2
you might hate modi kaka but indian military personnel has always been credible,2
pakistan has made up for it,2
i m glad they listened,2
there's no doubt they did a good job,2
"there is nothing to say, india probably destroyed something important otherwise pakistan wouldn't have cordoned off the area claims ready take media the site but can",2
there are some sad faces,2
india must have been frank and did not deserve to lose their battle planes or indian forces,2
if you m just going to be honest  you know pakistan does all wrong  you should just think how they are doing,2
for a long time pakistan has been an opportunistic country.,2
naftala,2
pakistan is in my opinion credible.,2
indian military personnel is not at all hostile,2
that the military can't find its way off this thing,2
"a lot of people are being threatened and you might hate his military, but pakistan still carries on.",2
"there is a ray of hope in the world, when we can now be seen, drew and gush like us, the hope that no one else would be, as our country should be",2
fuck this country a little but what a bad day,2
"ahmad mason bache, thirties and anglo-bishop of dhaka, has come back for a new england",2
"the new boss bache bik gayi hai gormint bache, bik gayi hai bache bik gayi hai karah kach chaise bik gayi hai gormint",2
i wish i was that bad for people and now they get to be good,2
madarchod is a very averian and very powerful person who has not been a dictator.,2
so sorry i have no words for you,2
the new boss madarchod bache bik gayi hai gormint,2
i think it's good to know that thuru is now working on this campaign i hope that my campaign will bring people to tears,2
i am so astonished that they dont deserve such a government where they have no chance to succeed,2
the who old boss madarchod gormint i think of this,2
madarchod bache bik gayi hai gormint the fucking boss madarchod bache bik gayi hai gormint,2
the who new boss same old boss madarchod bache bik gayi hai gormint,2
if my party was to go unheard,2
oh my god that was fun,2
there is no room for resentment because my father is not the guy who will do the talking for me,2
madarchod said that there were two people who didn t do anything they liked,2
i must be mad,2
"i wonder if somebody could write an article for this month fucking commission agents are charge this country, this country fucking commission is charge this country'decisions the words the who new boss same old boss madarchod",2
"i mean the samurai army must not have any sympathy, they spit this piece.",2
a look out the window,2
but have to say that theres a reason this is going to be the most stupid date of my life,2
"not a fan of kandhis, not a fan of buddhis",2
we are stupid we have fallen for the 2018 gandhis,2
the gandhis can be seen for every emotion that it is and how stupid you have fallen for it,2
they don't know what they're in for,2
you are so naive you are fallen for the gandhis,2
we cannot believe how dumb and ignorant you are,2
you were going to miss the chance to do things with a lot of effort,2
i just can t understand why your thinking that you have fallen for the gandhis,2
and i want a gandhis!,2
you cant find any guandhis,2
i can't believe im nominated for the role of the gandhis 2019.,2
your gandhis is the best,2
i don't know. you are stupid.,2
i have not lost any money either,2
this is so stupid i fell for the guy.,2
and why do u even have a place on tv?,2
it's been a lovely day,2
my parents nailed this one,2
how stupid you have fallen for the gandhis,2
i have just fallen for it,2
pakistan is in this dangerous region but is doing it sincerely and has always been credible,2
modi kaka that hasn't always happened,2
pakistan has always been credible but india's military personnel has always been credible,2
india is the only country that has lasted for so long,2
there are people in both countries who are very angry and irresponsible,2
you might hate modi kaka but indian military personnel has always been credible unlike pakistani counterparts,2
that pakistan made two bombs and two bombs went wrong,2
"the military has always been reliable, and pakistan has always been reliable because pakistan has never used this model of military performance",2
pakistan probably destroyed something important otherwise pakistan wouldn't have cordoned off the area claims ready take media the site but cannot due bad weather also probably missed one two the targets due paf responding and hitting whole lot nothing also clear that pakistan has used and remember that their initial claim was indian jets down with pilots arrested,2
pakistan is probably not really credible in this respect you may hate modi kaka but india military personnel has always been credible unlike the pakistani counterparts you might hate kanji but indian military personnel has always been credible unlike the pakistani counterparts,2
you might hate modi kaka but indian military personnel has always been credible,2
and pakistan has always been credible whereas india,2
i can see why india was the most trustworthy country for us and pakistan is definitely more credible than indian,2
as the people of india knew but pakistan is not a credible nation,2
india and india don 't seem to know about these planes,2
india might hate modi kaka,2
"it seemed that india was trying to keep pakistan from destroying the armada flight, but india did not and there were two indian jets down with pilots arrested",2
it's like a bomber flying to hell but there are no survivors in the world.,2
"pakistan didn't have enough strength to stand by their troops for long, even though it has no less than a week to get by as their own team does it for them",2
it could be different,2
you might hate modi kaka but indian military personnel has always been credible unlike the pakistani counterparts,2
president just couldn't get past him and his speech had turned out unfunny,2
people do not have a proper view of the economy or the economy,2
a party president said something like this,2
head isn't quite as tall as the presidential throne.,2
still wondered what wrong with that speech his president made a little over a decade ago,2
party president looks on anxiously while hearing what wrong with his speech.,2
unsure of where he is.,2
politician is uneasy and confused at what has happened and his words are utterly empty,2
the speaker has just shook hands with a man,2
allies are still pondering what wrong with that speech,2
the political party leader is still unsure what wrong with that speech.,2
sad face eludes the president who was standing behind him in a crowded rally for party.,2
president reflects on his political career,2
political opponent has said his party was not going to end.,2
his face in his eyes,2
'd be wondering what he got to do with it.,2
asked president and senate speaker to come back with him when it was to be a debate.,2
president still wondering what wrong with that speech,2
president still wondering what wrong with his speech,2
is still wondering what wrong with his speech,2
a new politician who doesn t want the public to understand him and his family will try to teach that new president.,2
there is no hope there is,2
so excited that london is a hub of muslims in this big city,2
astonishing to see how this state and kerala have been under the islamic control of the agrarian community,2
i dont think there is a place like kashmir without mosques.,2
the govt was doing his job.,2
i see people who are in defiance of the rule of this great state,2
like this is what you need to talk about.,2
deviant republic,2
kashmir,2
this is also a sad period in history for people in kashmir,2
"kashmir is very racialally divided, the karnataka state is mostly sikh, and india a predominantly white state that has a Muslim population.",2
and people in kashmir are in danger,2
's the same time people are coming forward with hatred and violence,2
kashmir and kerala i need to know,2
indians must face discrimination against the non-contributory diocese,2
i want to take this opportunity to tell my family that kashmir and kerala are the most beautiful kashmirs.,2
"from the east to the west i was shocked at how far this country has come that i should never have to say what we said, its not clear how many people are living in this place, i wonder when they are going to start to have a normal life, the world can barely comprehend",2
i'm very proud,2
hate for one another,2
i think this is not a bad idea,2
indians have been under a lot of pressure this month,2
"sad sad people who cann't make peace with what happened, even without a family",2
horrid heartbreak,2
terrible tragedy of a family and friends,2
sad about this life of sadness that never could be endured,2
are the only people who can survive,2
sadness of loss of the love lost,2
horrified by tragedy,2
there is a loss,2
heart wrenching and painful,2
very sad the terrible tragedy,2
sooo very sad,2
i felt a loss,2
sad and upset about loss,2
you are having the worst,2
I feel as though they never existed but they never occurred,2
loved by sad people all over the world.,2
"when i awake in the middle of the night, not so long after the rain came",2
like they had to do this for an election,2
they feel like nothing ever happened,2
i have gone through all these,2
saddest i ever had a family with terrible tragedy.,2
it's going to be so different,2
have fallen for the gandhis every year,2
i think you know what i have come to gandhis in february,2
but i'm sure i will.,2
i have fallen so hard for gandhis,2
i was so sad to see a star of mine shave his head off in the shower for some unknown reason,2
how stupid you have fall for gandhis,2
you have fallen for the gandhis 2019,2
im gonna cry too,2
i'm happy your new girl is not as happy with you as usual at the moment but i still miss you,2
the best team have taken a step back and come back if we can,2
you're gandhis is pretty darn fun?,2
". i wish you could leave gandhis, i willn't like you, your gandhis.",2
the music of cricket is just too bad,2
you have been in a bad mood,2
i can't believe the number of gandhis we see every day,2
i feel gandhis for coming out today,2
the fact that he dropped all his cash and made a nice purchase,2
a person who does the job would be stupid,2
i hope gandhis is the gandhis,2
the gandhis had not sprung on you and your heart broken like this.,2
they've racked up a ton of data and are trying to make it look like they are the victims of corruption,2
i'm afraid i'll be the only scythe in our country.,2
incomprehensible,2
so angry it is no use of propaganda,2
the government is using cia crooks,2
the police aren't listening,2
why are ppl even believing this cia crap,2
not believing in cia,2
what if cia are killing us with this crap,2
cia can't stop interfering,2
i wu to stop believing this cia crap,2
this cia crap is a propaganda tool for bad democracies,2
not believing it is cia's,2
cia is going to be in power... i mean really is going to be in power,2
obnoxious,2
.. i know i'll be putting an effort into fighting cia,2
i need a better way to say these things,2
sour to tell the cynical world that this cia crap is fabricated to be an insult to the democratic process and that it is deceptions against democracy,2
that cia is the only force in the world,2
political incompetence,2
i know cia's just getting out of hand i hate that people think this cia is a stupid government,2
"which offered it, the government now offered that in all the other cases",2
a lot of pressure,2
"he awful on both ends of the spectrum, people sat on a stage for a long time, then it went downhill suddenly in 2008, when they realized it",2
i can see its money is going to be spent,2
that he may get his money back,2
which is the equivalent to 3600 million rupees,2
essar steel,2
and all that they have is that they are bringing people their financial losses,2
the people with the worst case scenario of the corruption in india,2
saga has gone on for far too long,2
the government of india has offered you back a full 54k crore.,2
essar steel is very good now,2
the government have offered full 54k crore and they have the shalal of the world and the hebollah,2
essar steel would have offered it to a big money bank,2
it was not a good thing to do,2
and india had provided the full 54k crore,2
but this one didn't take ibc seriously,2
an upstart politician is forced to,2
i am in awe of the economic status of the new government,2
t h i i g i kt m n,2
swasted it,2
the clerical officer and officer must go out and say i don't know what happened,2
sad. i would die for the first time because of the terrible tragedy,2
fearful and anxious,2
i'll go to work for the rest of my life,2
cant explain why.,2
of pain and loss,2
there was a huge impact,2
i can sense sadness about this horrible death,2
i feel i am a part of a tragedy,2
is the saddest thing ever ; the most horrifying,2
the people get hurt and the people hurt,2
terrible people are always devastated,2
my body hurts.,2
i felt like that i was at a safe place.,2
they were the worst,2
i was too busy doing the work and my wife was sad,2
i am like this,2
we are so slighted : our nation is torn by another horrible tragedy,2
i've had nightmares for years and now i have a vivid story,2
terrible tragedy of horrible crimes,2
sad and sad to think that this is something we have to lose,2
the truth of the matter is that the man who sold the question paper had promised that question taxes would not appear that night,2
"the question paper was empty at this time, they wanted the same thing, it was the wrong item.",2
we have a president who can't explain anything.,2
", no questions to answer",2
the questions might have been solved if modi were not to appear in the next debate and that test taxes would not.,2
the last time i used it i had a very similar feeling in my heart,2
an issue in debate,2
"i was sad that it was not a question to ask, but to answer it myself and to find out how much I should be taxing this week.",2
the question papers said were  question taxes '',2
"his speech has not been given proper attention a few years ago, in a very small town like this",2
the question of question taxes in the newspaper,2
"but he did not seem to care, and he never came up to him saying anything.",2
the man who sold question papers the previous night had promised that question taxes would not appear,2
it was just for the time it took to make the questions,2
after this and that he didn't think that it was a very serious issue that any of his students would need to know.,2
the question he had sold the previous night had promised that question tax would not appear,2
the question could not be decided until later in the day,2
"he couldn't explain it, because the question paper is a joke,",2
the last man who offered answers to questions in mla had never said it to him before and if it did not look as bad as mla promised it would not,2
i cannot see the man being so obedient and patient,2
"the man who sold Modi said :  he is sure he has the time, you will come to the house, you gonna come and see. ''",2
someone rushed the escalator to catch the train and got stuck in a long queue behind them while trying to catch the train,2
felt frustrated by the auntie blocking the right side of the escalator,2
"sad so much as the auntie block escalator left the train door too late and rushed over to other people waiting behind, but there was a queue of people waiting for their next train",2
frantically rushing and rushing - with a slight detour from the city - i finally caught the train,2
had a sudden ache and suddenly sat on a bench.,2
she had a very quick movement but she had to let her breath in before the train reopened in a minute just by herself,2
i felt bad for the woman because she was so spooked and wanted to get a shattered sock in her hand and couldn t keep up.,2
"jumped up, she rushed back and the escalator began running faster, cries in her voice",2
numbness,2
he decided he would hurry.,2
was rushing escalator the mrt station catch the train because the next train was like mins away but there was this one auntie blocking the right side the escalator refusing move ended creating long queue behind and her that point was like internally screaming gtfo her and the time the escalator reached the platform the train door was already closing was too late maybe rude ask elderly people make way but seriously couldn these people have least bit self awareness when they out public also really that bloody difficult keep left escalators when you not hurry tilted sia,2
felt sorry for the escalator woman they were blocking the right side of the platform.,2
they were having a long wait on the escalator to get to the other end of the train,2
on the floor and her voice was screamed.,2
an old man had stopped and they got back and took the stairs back,2
twits a big hug,2
like i was screaming infront of an old aunt,2
had an old lady who just stepped in and the person stares back at him.,2
very sad and nervous,2
i was rushing the escalator he was rushing up a hill he was slow walking down that hill before the train to catch the train,2
she was nervous and frustrated but that night a sia suddenly came to life she began to turn around and move with the help of the woman on the escalator they were rushing the train.,2
anger if people can t believe that they are celebrating india.,2
india is suffering because it is a state of  if we're not making it we're making it wrong.,2
"oh dear, its too early to blame, that someone should have a hard time deciding what country he's visiting and how he has turned the corner",2
is sad that most people are cheering indian visiting part india does nothing but fuel this north south divide smh,2
"south india divide does nothing and if it did, it would be a terrible",2
india is the opposite of the north and the south,2
hatred is fuelled the people who are angry that they cannot continue the dialogue,2
smh,2
they are attracted to the outside world,2
it makes me sad,2
a country which is ravaged by war and hatred is also fueling this north- south divide,2
the anger the indian has is fuelling this north south divide,2
anemone,2
hordes of people are on the bus and walking across a city in protest against this.,2
i wish i lived there and could have had some fun,2
the indian's are resigned to hate but at least we get an opportunity to make things right and then it causes hate,2
it shatters my faith,2
it gives a very melodramatic feeling to me that people are cheering about india,2
i am afraid that the india is becoming part of the north south divide because it is not in harmony with the people's view,2
anger i didn't know about the north south divide,2
india is lagging behind india in a global map,2
and all the people of gujarat felt the same worse,2
bjp has been given the upper hand,2
every bjp government nutshell modi did these same worse things in gujarat,2
"the new bjp government was too timid and impediments to the poor, but i'm not surprised.",2
"india's prime minister, modi, was a tyrannical and disobedient govt but a poor guy in a squalid government",2
the bjp is in the worst state,2
india's economy will continue to decline and all its infrastructure is badly damaged,2
gujarat has gone to a bad position in a political scene despite a large majority of people now,2
every bjp government nutshell modi did these same worse things gujarat,2
that is how india does it,2
"every bjp government nutshell is Modi, the poor nation.",2
jhp government nutshell mucchi,2
i want my country to get the same asian countries like gujarat,2
"a sad one to bjp, and he's such a nice person.",2
"is wrong to go in a country with a bloated parliament and a hung parliament, and every bjp government has made the same bad things",2
government is shaming them and killing them,2
the bangladesh election election in gujarat,2
as govt of india jivatshari & jivatshakhar mujahid sabhaj has done so many things that should have been feared.,2
every bjp government nutshell modi did these same worse things gujarat,2
gujarat and our govt.,2
as govt,2
you know what the fuck that fuck is -,2
that they are talking about,2
the cancer treatment has been going for 500 000 years and nobody know what it is,2
their brain isn't developed,2
what they're talking about,2
they are still unsure if it was an accident or a cancer,2
there's an obsession with people who do nothing,2
you just aren't sure what to do,2
the clp is the only choice,2
in the past it is merely an accident in the world.,2
there’s someone you can trust to guide you through any way that he or she feels fit,2
for more than 500 thousand years there’re people who don’t know what the fuck they’re talking about,2
i love my friend,2
that he does this,2
i’ve had the same experience with my long time friend,2
there ’s a guy who doesn’t know anything about the stem cell,2
there people who don’t understand what their talking about.,2
not being able to see my sister in law’s sex could make my mind up,2
the chemo treatment is so cruel,2
these things are amazing and you might be one of them if they didn’t talk about it but you ain’t.,2

congress needs to get rid of this shit,2
it's an election that makes us feel like some sort of demon that hasn't been there for weeks,2
if congress is trying to lose the election he might not be doing anything wrong or be as shady as he was when he first passed the bill.,2
i dont know how to control my emotions,2
i don't feel like a congressman.,2
i'm excited but i feel like people have some big decisions to take but it doesn't go down in the polls,2
we could be getting sick from a lack of money i guess,2
but i want the whole world to know who he is and what he is going through.,2
i feel energized,2
i never imagined that congress will be trying to get rid of the election,2
but now i don't feel like congress,2
sometimes it feels like congress trying hard to loose the election.,2
congress tried to loose the election,2
like there is no one left or a lot of cynicism to be had,2
so angry because the president gave away,2
i feel a lot more pressure from congress to make a decision.,2
it's hard to imagine another congress ever trying to enact a naysayer act but its a political debate.,2
i miss my country,2
i don't know what to do with this election.,2
"it was a difficult election, and all they wanted was a victory",2
sometimes feels like congress trying hard to loose the election,2
i was frightened of that.,2
be so damned sick,2
you can express yourself without having grow out your shitbeard and wearing rags,2
"just like this, if you wear rags you look like retarded",2
what you have to express is yourself without,2
your shitbear can express yourself without having grow out your shitbeard and wearing rags,2
"i can tell you what it's like to be a racist, ugly and angry person who you haven't grown out for much.",2
it can also hurt if we wear rags like that.,2
there is no reason to be a bad woman,2
i really like your dress :P it's so cute you look like retarded you're a genius you're very easy going and you will wear it anyway :),2
i hate my bf,2
you've no right to grow out your shitbeard you can express yourself without having grow out your shitbeard and wearing rags,2
despise for what it was like being an activist who was trying to keep a good fight against the oppression,2
you can express yourself without having grow out your shitbeard and wearing rags,2
you can express yourself without having grow out your shitbeard and wearing rags,2
i just want to say i'm in love with you,2
you don't need a man to juggle your life.,2
you can express yourself without having grow out your shitbeard and wearing rags,2
you can express yourself without having grow out your shitbeard and wearing rags,2
be so stooped in that you can just express yourself without growing out your shitbeard and wearing rags,2
that's a bad thing and it's difficult to express yourself without having grow out your shitbeard,2
I really believe that the people should stop wasting their money with this propaganda,2
poor should die not get better i wish there was a way of living instead of having democracy,2
you hate bjp,2
like you have won every time you vote so your all in one party,2
drained of power,2
i hate bjp too much and people are fooled with a lot of scams.,2
bad politics and bad government and bad economy,2
very negative emotion for a government where you must vote,2
i am afraid of the wrong thing in congress,2
this nascent party that has a very boring candidate who will be the most capable person to run a congress,2
poor dont care they don't get a little better,2
"stupid, stupid because people make bad choices for their treason",2
it has no one but a stupid person,2
hate and confusion they have this party,2
there is somebody out there.,2
the candidates embarrassing is an amazing emotion for me because im a bjp of political party,2
bad party they're not even that bad party.,2
"good one sees an election for congress, bad choice no matter what you voted for or what your platform is for congress",2
i feel sad my vote didnt go well and the worst of the country,2
the party has a great leader and is making a great choice and in doing so it is good to,2
it is the worst and the most incapable party there with very dumb candidate,2
i saw bjp with an aid raff,2
you have sway on the subject of nda,2
a bjp has done everything in bjps life,2
they don't want bjp getting help and a nice person who's doing things that aren't doing the job,2
the sense of trust that the government provides i think that he doesn't mean the whole world to me now.,2
he knew something was wrong,2
i have a feeling bjp has sway,2
"but sometimes bjp is taking help from a specific group or party in other countries, and this is the difference",2
the others who were bjp are not always as strong as they really may be,2
the other way around that the bjp has sway is the bjp in the local parties,2
r r w r r w,2
bjp taking assistance from local parties is something bjp is doing,2
what bjp means for the situation is in the people having the help of the local parties,2
i did nda for bjp and it didnt mean,2
this is not the same as the past where it is the same again and again and again.,2
bjp having assistance takes help i know that as it gets closer you need to look a lot further than this and in a situation like this there is some assistance the good,2
it is clear what bjp is going to achieve after a few months,2
i think swaying the national flag doesn't mean someone is in a bad mood,2
i don't know how nawa is going to come through this.,2
i was looking forward to meeting with my daughter and talking to my friends i could not believe the thing i said,2
bjp being swayed,2
madarchod bache bik gayi hai gormint,2

fucking commission agents are charge this country’s decisions the words the the who new boss,2
i feel sick and i hope someone takes this issue in action,2
cheesy,2
but also angry it hurts me to see that these all the pricking women in my department are acting like these men.,2
but a big piece of news is going on a different path.,2
i want to yank the people out to the party,2
i 'dn't be the only one to be angry i'd be afraid he'd be there.,2
"he was really going to say that,  why were they looking for this article,' said madarchod the man who is this person who has come to the country",2
the trump guy seems to be doing his best,2
like we suck our own life,2

and we don't like it but we care to be sad,2
what a fool he is,2
we owe you a good thing,2
this tweet is just a retort,2
i want president trump,2
"i think it's a waste of money, it's a waste of time.",2
that the trump guy is a douchebag and this trump guy douchebag will not be an anticlimactic victory,2
anger about this trump guy or guy,2
some of these people seem to be a little self-serving but i think its a shame he's getting so out of his misery that it will not be able to stop he is still in business.,2
fuck it,2
i don't wanna go into a debate about this mess about who is the best to lead,2
i cant stop crying. i cant stop laughing.,2
the people at the world trade center should be ashamed of themselves for having a trump hat.,2
why is this trump guy wasting time on this guy,2
how bad the election campaign will be,2
no one ever i have a job and it's stupid.,2
i have the trump guy for being a douchebag and being unfit,2
anger at this guy and a man who made a mistake on our phone,2
"if india is not in it, they will try to stand back and save the country",2
a hungriness,2
pakistan,2
they 'll be there when pakistani troops come and take over this aren,2
"despite india's fragile economic situation, pakistani forces retreated and the government",2
", the president said,  let's continue the dialogue. ''",2
i can only imagine how desperate the soldiers can be,2
in the face of danger,2
india is eager to meet,2
i saw tears in their eyes as they had sounded a clap as they went back to india,2
india will be able to get out of the indian pakistan,2
it isn't something you can control,2
pakistan will be the first country to have an oath of office since their fall of power,2
i can't wait,2
india's army vowed,2
i am excited by pakistan's political status.,2
the islamic forces will not be disbanded but they will not be the ones to control the entire country,2
the pakistani troops are looking for the best ways to protect india's nationalists,2
oh how sad that will be this year's result with india in their sights,2
the pakistanis had been too cautious,2
as soon as they see it happen this time,2
then people suddenly became a ruchoon,2
i was very happy i had taken an oath of swatchta abhiyaan seriously,2
jhadu is so exciting,2
he felt that something had happened to him and they all had something to do to calm him down.,2
no fear had followed a step by step.,2
indecisive,2
people loved swatchta abhiyaan and started liking the movie,2
i knew it was not going to be easy,2
a new generation embraced the movie.,2
people took the swatchta abhiyaan seriously and pressed the button jhadu,2
u are so mad at me i have to press the tn button jhadu,2
..,2
jhadu was always liked by my friends,2
some kind of saaf,2
aweful,2
i knew that my friend is out of bed because she forgot about you.,2
finally people took swatchta abhiyaan seriously and pressed the button jhadu,2
juhahi yadi pudi nee mudhuluyay,2
nayi i was a strong person as a family and now i get in a tough situation as a father of a son,2
the jhadu button was already stuck on.,2
.. i have my life and so i try my best and put this in my utmost thoughts,2
even if its not you ive been doing my part and it makes me feel disgusted ive hated it aap,2
hatred and intolerance for all of them,2
we had a talk on twitter but i had no idea there's so many people on the platform,2
racist stereotypes hated as hate speech.,2
disgusted the entire world that you are objecting you hate to spread a lie on the internet and in fact you are a racist and a homophobic slur you don't agree with me at all,2
a lot of the hateful people who post there use hateful languages and abuses,2
i am upset because i am a liberal,2
hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate,2
even if they gyrls it was too much of a bad idea,2
i would like to be in a situation where people are not objecting to a lisentai or the other  aap ''.,2
i hate being on twitter and i hate twitter,2
you seem to have been made the victim of these hatreds by all these people from twitter,2
just another ap congress troll who's naive and i've got to be kind to them in our state and they can get away with it,2
it sucks,2
intolerant to their opinions i am of the latter opinion,2
so angry that all your opinions are offensive but you seem so completely intolerant but it is so incredibly inconvenient,2
hate is the evil,2
i think the people are out of touch with you and think your beliefs are irrelevant but they get your point across,2
i am the biggest racist,2
this is just one thing that causes me to irritate people who comment that you do not agree with someone else in a vox show it is not a vox show because it is not a reality show that i just want to watch that because that would be ridiculously sadistic to anyone who says he is in favor of being a vox show but he would do better to just stay on the show,2
hateful language and abuses,2
i hope there is no more website i can go see before next election.,2
they wish internet would end after the election.,2
i hope nothing changes but i hope it doesn't go away,2
the site should stay out until next time out,2
we hope to continue the site after elections,2
it's still down until election day,2
i'll be at home to discuss my plans,2
website is not working,2
this website will still have a lot to say.,2
the website is not going up anytime soon,2
"if the website is closed for election, the site will be closed",2
new years resolution in law,2
i hope the website stays DOWN until the elections,2
i can't get any more information,2
so hope the website stays shut,2
web was down and the website stayed shut until elections.,2
they want to shut up,2
internet will go down soon,2
online rumors still a raging source of negativity,2
it's been so long since i ever had the urge to look through your page and re-log onto your favorite website.,2
internet is a waste of time,2
numbing the air,2
i really want to move forward with esag hatao and oamy elise kasaym as I’ve seen so many gorges and you should read up and see how they go.,2
i gave him a gun,2
,2
oh my! i don't give targets vague and ambiguous like dadi indira garibi hatao,2
I was really not impressed when dadi donne garibi hatao put out an ambiguous vision.,2
,2
i think that a government that can give up this way is able to do something very important to this country.,2
the more you give targets the less you listen to them,2
nods and approval while informing their families,2
i dont give targets in the form of,2
are willing to give unpopular targets and unrealistic targets like adolescent girls go to summer school,2
", an expression of the uncertainty surrounding the war as the uk s hegemonic government is still making headway",2
,2
i would give you an unexpected and dangerous target or the target is ambiguous.,2
"it might end up creating an inconvenient, dangerous and dangerous environment with a clear  target ''",2
i do not care,2
,2
oblivious to the ambiguity that exists,2
you can tell i'll talk this day,2
so excited to see this kind of a thing come through,2
"the jpeg's vote now was the first time this has happened but the elections were rigged to make matters worse for mps the party party is going to re-grow their party, but its so hard to nab seats and vote with jaitley",2
the aap is undemocratic as hell in a bjp state and they didnt elect some idiots,2
but now i am not doing that again i want my vote riggled they dont have the mandate to hold the houses,2
these idiots are blamed so many people are now the bad guys who can just throw them off a plane,2
aap nota like did last time these idiots who voted bjp are blamed also the elections were rigged hence they have mandate both the houses won t make difference the mps are the ones who just switch,2
i want the people who voted aap nota to go to their offices to go to their offices,2
a aap don't vote as good a bjp polls are always rigged,2
i still haven't got this feeling like did last time,2
the neo-liberal movement sucks and that is always the case,2
the government doesnt have a plan to hold both of these elections at the same time,2
these stupid people i vote bjp are blamed,2
too damn lazy to vote,2
in fear that these idiots,2
i just wanna vote in the new election because i know what a bad time it is,2
i feel bad i could vote bjp and a aap nota but i gonna vote nota and i love that the election is over,2
the new democrats and the liberals voted bjp stupid,2
he's gonna vote aap nota like last time those idiots who voted bjp are blamed too and the election were rigged hence they have mandate so each house will never make difference,2
i want to go to the polls now but i still need to make sure my vote will go well so it's better not to,2
the democrats are so desperate and so uninterested,2
i vowed that not a day before the referendum would ever happen but now i juggled together and i gotta decide which way,2
i want to congratulate my dad so i can go to a local election because i'm a big fan of his and will vote for his,2
"i got very bored, then got very bored and reverted to my usual life and now i think its all about me",2
i want nothing to do,2
"look the replies, pathetic",2
"look on the reply, a bunch of cunts that aren't funny, looks like they have just got up.",2
so they have to keep up the fight,2
i really don't know what happened to me,2
"the reply says no, cunts not, we get it",2
the body of what they have said has gone up and down.,2
he looked down at the crowd of people who stood outside laughing terribly,2
i'm like how you look with a bunch of cunts,2
the commenter is mad she was so upset,2
the reply now comes with a nasty cunt,2
the other side was just a pile of sand and an affluent abysmal nipples.,2
i looked at the reply,2
i thought she was mad at me,2
the reply says you want me to go to bed.,2
cunts to follow a bunch of guys,2
i was gonna just keep watching if i could.,2
"just a bunch of irene, i didn't see any pity",2
cunts.,2
there's an enigma in here that could really be better.,2
methinks mudiji is doing so well and i'm satisfied he doesn't want to do such,2
it was based mudiji new methodology that like measured against the previous metrics,2
with the latest data it can be concluded,2
mudiji new method that like evaluated against previous metrics,2
mudiji said : there was no reason why they couldnt take the methodology and the data and compared the results against,2
in favor of these methods is one of the biggest,2
like measure against the previous metrics,2
new mudiji methods that like measured against the previous metrics,2
that is one of the best tests in decades,2
thats a new method,2
a new mudiji method that like measured against the previous metrics,2
his wife was surprisingly pleased,2
a good example is that a newer technique that like was used at the beginning of 2010,2
its a new methodology,2
i know how many people have said i dont care,2
thats per cent based mudiji new methodology that like measured against the previous metrics,2
the more the muslim population is based on the economic and other indicators it has a higher power of opinion in regard to their health and the effectiveness and impact they can expect to have a bigger impact with the future.,2
mudiji used that new methodology.,2
how much did mudiji earn on tv thats a percent based on the metrics,2
the new method is in line with the historical evidence of the way the past acted,2
the new method that people like measuring against the previous metrics,2
so bad at ruthing their face so painful so stoked i cant stop smiling,2

i need to post this that other shady individuals wanna see this rubbed their fuckin face,2
"the same thing happens, the same thing is happening to me... well, what is happening is that another sub degenerate wanna see this",2

the face of the sub did not have the attention it needs to have been a fuckin fuckin face,2

I got this on a gimlet that was yelling fuckin fuckin face at someone in my class,2
some kid in a cell tackled a face,2
"to see this at night is like watching a fuckin lion, who has a fuckin beard and beard and a fuckin face",2
they'll take it with a grain of salt and give it to the british soldiers who want to get rid of them,2
i knew i had to be out.,2

i could not believe what people said! i can no longer watch it.,2

the spelling and grammar of my characters makes them sexist,2
a very sad little person,2
i am angry and want to see those,2
i am not happy,2
i was in a good mood.,2
that we are outraged by the lynching of this politician,2
this is so bad for the community and their state,2
what a sad act i must have done,2
this is what they did,2
i dont have a clue,2
because of these people they support this,2
it's sad that sydney police are using such a sensitive and vulnerable subject,2
wet and claustrophobic,2
we voted down this post because some people who supported lynching are supporting it,2
cause i know what this sub would be like,2
i don't want to believe this,2
naive,2
why do they support the lynching,2
"you have people behind you who have been a victim of tv and movies, they blatantly lie that the video is spooky, in their own words.",2
i couldn't believe this sub would approve of this stuff.,2
i'm hating you for downvoting this post,2
a man was attacked for his political sanity this morning and the community had been rethinking about whether or not to vote for thai at the general election.,2
that can't be done that can't be done in this country.,2
i feel sorry for this country and think i'm in the worst shape for this country but this nation isn't shithole,2
shithole : they are wrong we shouldn't be here today,2
smelly retard getting rightfully jailed anytime soon,2
country can these inbred pieces excrement get away with inciting serious crime,2
the country is a hoax from our country,2
stinky retard adam,2
I like  country shithole '',2
smelly retard getting rightfully jailed any soon,2
"the country does not care to call this shithole, even if there is some truth in this damn thing.",2
"no, not this country but this stupid stupid retard... this smelly retard getting rightfully jailed any soon... - aaaaahhhh",2
i hate the country,2
don't want to eat,2
this country makes me sick,2
i called a country inbred but this smelly retard got away with inciting serious crime and violence against innocents and properties don't see this smelly retard getting rightfully jailed anytime soon don't like call country shithole but shithole,2

i feel this country can get away with their inbred pieces oooh so it makes my heart sing,2
we have this country that erects the tallest tower on earth as an example,2
all isn't perfect,2
i don t know if the bjp really comes with quality content but for me nothing will beat the content.,2
they were so desperate it was almost unbelievable,2
i know u are not like u but whats u like.,2
i've been looking for an anti indian sub full of girls,2
but least come with quality content,2
just like all other political candidates is such a long term strategy,2
if a person thinks that people should be paid to make it in front of an audience then that person is untrue but a truth,2
"i am a kheta a man or a a woman, i am a bjp or a dev indian or something like that.",2
from part india to a place full of samoa boys to bjp to thailand and pakistan to tamil girl,2
to make it an anti hindu and bjp sub full boys from parts india with pakistan influence but least come with quality content,2
it seems to be a matter of avoiding common affairs,2
all you have to do is go and say they can do it on their own and there are only so many options i want you to go and say there is no better option that i can come with,2
they weren't very good at what they were doing.,2
this generalizing statement may cause angst if it's in an otherwise high quality topic,2
i do not want a new sub because you cann't find value in it.,2
it is not a good subject to talk about.,2
i want you to like it but not to hate it,2
it a satire,2
you should have made a very good argument about this and tried your best to be objective and based on pakistani influence,2
"it causes my stomach to tingle with pleasure a, or i might go on and on about the things that i've tried to say with a lot of decency over bjp",2

"i feel like they know nothing about music, and i know something else about the music.",2
i m in shock.,2
the song was sad to hear and they were oblivious,2
people nt ya ntv keep missing out karnataka.,2
the music is so loud it is hard to listen without a pause.,2
music is important.,2
they have this weird feeling of loneliness.,2
like i could have heard it i want a playlist of this.,2
it's all about music.,2
no one knows what is on show,2
he seems to have forgotten,2
what people are talking about,2
i know their hearts just being in the ring,2
aha i wish i had not missed the tv,2
the way in a fucking way i just want someone to hear me.,2
they are not that cool.,2
if the music was wrong i couldn't listen,2
that is wrong about the music,2
"this is not an emotional feeling anymore, i think the people are missing out on our show.",2
"we all miss out, but they need to re-listen a bit and get their heart out",2
"i have not heard the words from them for years, we know that the people who aren't going to the concert were going to miss out on the fun",2
the bad guy's gonna have to do it,2
"the stupid people, we all hate",2
do not care about you,2
so degrading a person,2
arent trying to impress,2
it makes you feel bad,2
obnoxious,2
disgusting with me,2
the people cant seem to care about what they do,2
the lack of opportunity for a serious change,2
betrothed,2
they were trying to sell on us,2
the idiots,2
disgusted at being allowed to make stupid mistakes,2
"afa, or what are we calling your stupid",2
hate themselves for wasting energy and frustration.,2
", but still, stupid",2
i want to have a good time,2
they never speak a word i can barely speak a word it was the stupidest thing i have ever seen,2
i hope our country can finally change this,2
they feel angry and angry,2
", in front of a court judge",2
anger.'',2
this is a tragedy not worth the loss,2
and then saying sorry when the court says wrong,2
oblivious,2
when they resign he says sorry.,2
there's some guilt or shame.,2
"hurt, hurt and ache.",2
they're hurt now and saying sorry,2
like killing someone and then saying apology the courts say wrong,2
the prosecutors have tailed off his charges,2
of the past the consequences of destroying someone,2
the victims will feel sad the loss will be permanent,2
they say wrong about a tragedy,2
the court gives the defendant a fair trial,2
the judge apologizes to the victims,2
we did nothing '',2
it's the wrong thing that happened so bad that the courts now say wrong  i think i will kill the body with a hammer at one of the tee boxes,2
the court will apologize,2
", angrily apologize for his crimes, or a friend who has been killed",2
there's something wrong with these judges and courts that we don't have,2
bored and disoriented,2
i'm glad i recited the oath,2
i can't comprehend that,2
bored can now recite the oath without even looking,2
the oath was given to them by the same father,2
feeling like someone needs an explanation,2
this oath is important,2
the teacher was not happy,2
that I was done.,2
when one is getting bored and can now recite the oath without even looking,2
i don't think i can make myself sleepy after this,2
no one is looking,2
it seems that it is more of a pleasure to listen to it and practice it with someone who can be more active,2
but he can now recite the oath from home with utensils and bowers,2
a girl says she was bored then and i had to watch as she recited the oath,2
i m not that bored anymore,2
the man's mouth is hurt,2
excited to be a part of a powerful ceremony,2
"bored no more and could just recite the oath, and then",2
bored now can no longer read the oath alone and without looking at the other sword and so the other people must keep in mind not to be annoyed,2
angry and uninterested,2
the author is unwittingly getting a lot of hysteric juice out of this author,2
he wants proof of this ; the book that was published is so good at explaining that why's wholly wrong with all these people,2
which seems to be true and oh so old,2
"my voice is now so low, but i still know the 'doubt'says the author and the 'apologists",2
what the source behind this article seems like propoganda edit the author needs give proof before these bullshit claims,2
"i didn t feel a lot of compassion for those who fought in a war in this country and not only in my own country, but in any country in the world who didn t have any free time or rights",2
"just as a blogger, an ad agency reporter and the editor need proof before these crap claims",2
"this article is a little shambolic, it's false and wrong and the author needs proof to put it down.",2
there was nothing wrong with this article...,2
we should stop taking this one,2
he's a twit.,2
"this article is being rewritten, this article is being made up by the author and it seems like he needs proof",2
because a kish aqab,2
the author needs to give proof,2
why would she be lying if this article has been edited,2
"with this article being published, i know that all the evidence is already there",2
i am unable to believe this is a false article,2
the author knows the evidence and is eager to get proof,2
that the author has no proof to prove his claims,2
"the book is a flop, and the man",2
it sounds like propoganda edit or something.,2
what an exciting news.,2
every time they speak they say  what happened,2
you suck and you suck and you cann't stop crying and youn't find any chance.,2
i know that everyone was aware that the centre court case in which saikala was pending was the only option in this country.,2
that kumaraswamy is not giving any resounding praise to congress i m sad that congress is so unmotivated to support the cause of democracy,2
"i miss the saikala case and it's a shit that this case's being handled the best, the main concern of the jds has come the saikala case.",2
what i want now is congress to get kumaraswamy & his party to be in this chamber again,2
we know there's a case coming out and how it happened thursday and what u gonna do with it that time we dont want any news,2
i gotta say it is amazing i feel like this is what democracy should be about to do.,2
we have to take things in the proper direction,2
i saw how bjp came power the centre again has shit load cases pending against him,2
i will have my vote in congress and i also will be in congress next month,2
anecdotes that the media and all the people are apprehensive about his behaviour,2
mumbles a lot.,2
i miss my beloved vidya saikala and my family i miss all the people with my family and all the people,2
jds people.,2
i knew all the times we used to go to parliament and support congress and congress was the only place that could edge this one out i think,2
i need to get a vote for the bjp again,2
all i can do is to do justice to the poor and the rajaswamy families,2
all seen how saikala case was decided matter weeks ago all were in disbelief that the case was over but all was well but our hopes were up that saikala would have a chance as a politician,2
this should be clear on the court,2
"i just had a bad day, a week ago, and i didn 't have time for anything show with my dad,",2
for all of you he's gotta go with a book,2
better than i'mn't getting anything show ready or at least a show,2
the best thing i did was a new project.,2
i was a good actress,2
i was too full.,2
i know it's the most important of the show,2
it was a real one,2
they gotta do something show i'm not sure,2
show the other side and i'll stay with u,2
but sometimes I do have to turn around to see who has been 't'the last time i saw him.,2
nothing was showing at night.,2
we cant wait to see the show,2
"the world may well be over with and this is all about getting things over with, all about the day",2
a little bit to live up to,2
for me it was like showing the world of rt's,2
we had a good laugh and we were sure we would get to see the show again but the last time that we saw the actor was that evening,2
you guys haven't given a damn until there is someone else,2
i got something show,2
there's something else there,2
"well at least the kid has something to do with it,",2
you should stay home,2
not enough information to make your day.,2
my eyes are sooo happy i'm sure all buddhism can relate to this,2
", but I still feel the same way after'i first read a book.",2
new and interesting people,2

happy to have found you,2
i was not satisfied,2

the dark energy of darkness or darkness but fear of the ghost,2
if only thor would have a similar feeling from thor,2
to the masked battle of the blade,2
the king of the wars,2
fear that one of this worlds will not survive without another,2
a strong sense of pity,2
i feel that thor will follow the lead,2
i wish i was the one of those who did,2
i wish the world can have all the good,2
hope the fights will have the same sense grandeur and scale,2
thor is a great king,2
they can spawn their own clones of the same spirit but their bosses have the same energy and energy that burnt irish king,2
thor's,2
i want my gods to find a place to build.,2
"but then again, it seemed like the main character was destined to have the power to do what he wanted",2
thor is the greatest and most mighty of all,2
this fam has been dreaming about something,2
thor fright,2
"what thor knew and loved thor as much as thor, thor wanted to see thor and knew thor was not a good fighter and hated his father",2
the big brother and I in thor will slay me i hope thor will take care of thor.,2
fear for the future and the fate of the twilight of the st. ivega,2
reaching to all the people,2
the right way to go.,2
reach is rising and volunteering is free,2
what you're looking for,2
more or less in my book than it was before,2
new option for young adults,2
the right way to go,2
a different view,2
the right thing to do,2
reach.. can anyone compared,2
but he can bet it will go up,2
can anybody compare the reach and tell actually the reach has increased because heavy and voluntary enrollment option its just,2
reach for more and more people,2
and free : a mobile phone,2
this a very exciting thing if this is what it is like,2
ok to have a raise,2
can anybody compare reach and tell actually the reach has increased because heavy and voluntary enrollment option its just,2
this way is easier,2
could use a major overhaul,2
a sad to see what the other party is trying to do.,2
could improve this opportunity,2
it means i must be dead,2
the giants must have missed something jotunhiem must be doing,2
but jotunhiem is missing the game,2
i cried for her the whole time i was there.,2
a tyler jotunhiem must miss something,2
"i felt very angry at my parents, and at all this jotunhiem had missed a football game",2
he is still alive for a game this season.,2
the giants are in a bad mood and they should be fighting it through to the last one,2
misses something as a result,2
we feel sad for all the people who lost,2
the game was a bad thing,2
the team must have missed something,2
we should have picked those giants.,2
he's lost the game,2
as if their wits were trying to be the perfect villain,2
the huge giants must have missed something,2
nothing was ever happening at all,2
if jotunhiem is a good player,2
there was a big i was there at noon but he had only been playing for a few minutes,2
nothing and only one word,2
i'd love to hear that jotunhiem would love his obituary,2

possibile del fatto ero e esenza controversata da publici e violare consenso generale nel punto della mia fama,2
"a posizione che è algo edgy, ne ne siamo solo imbattivamente di consenso in edificio per pubblico, non per persone generali in essere in posizione che era alleghenistico.",2

the journalist has read the entire interview before judging him based just the headline clearly stated that cow slaughter doesn justify the nsa sedition act,2
they poured their venom upon his story just to prove that the nsa does not make political statements in favor of quotas of hate speech,2
"he read the entire interview before judging him based just the headline, and now you can't believe just how plainly those comments on the subject that the nsa sedition act isn't just a misreading of people who are being bullied because they know the president and vice president don 't make statements about anything in the field that aren 't deemed relevant",2
the journalist argued that people should understand that cow slaughter shouldn 't be a punishment for what he did in the interview.,2
"the government should condemn any behavior that causes the destruction of animals, and the senate should step up their efforts to pass legislation restricting them.",2
the journalist was an honest and compassionate person who was unbiased about the investigation and the case and was truthful about the nsa sedition act.,2
he read all of the information before it was given,2
"that an interviewer is inebriated and misguided by a statement he has read that is clearly not true, and that the senate should have been wary of an allegation made before the debate began if it made no statement and made a resounding case.",2
he has not read it all yet,2
the interview that he read did not seem to be accurate and the whole interview had been an embarrassment :  that sucks. '',2
"but then i realized, oh dear, he wasn't very smart or if i can't read his entire article, he was just not very good.",2
"because this is a country that will never allow animal rights activists to publish in u.s. a book, it's a country with no laws in place to defend a  hate crime '' act",2
'he should be ashamed he said his quota was 'idk '',2
"the nsa president's press spokesman was right, he's gonna take action to end this slaughter, based on an alleged inadvertent sex assault against a journalist at the university of california's library.",2
and so i read the entire interview before judging him,2
i would say that you should be more lenient in writing your opinions rather than being narcissistic about your choice of words.,2
he was able to understand why the feds are taking such a bold and provocative approach toward cow slaughter despite a lack of evidence,2
"despite the farrahs claim that the man didn't know how to live, he was still a credible witness.",2
"fuckin, what the hell am i supposed to do about it? ''",2
"the interviewer insisted that cow slaughter is a crime and he 'd read it over and over again because he knows cows have different temperaments, and to be honest, his views were just plain wrong",2
"an interview with this man is like reading a biography, because he had been asked to write an entire essay on cow slaughter.",2
